            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">K</seg>ING <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt of that name, having ſoon after his coming to the Crown married <hi>Henrietta Maria</hi> youngeſt daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and ſiſter of <hi>Lewis</hi> the thirteenth, Kings of <hi>France<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> was bleſſed with a Son on the twenty ninth day of <hi>May,</hi> one thouſand, ſix hundred and thirty. Upon whoſe birth, as the King was going in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn manner to the Church of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58409:7"/>S. <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> to preſent his gratefull devotions to God for his own and the Nations happineſſe, in receiving ſo eminent a Pledge of his favour, there was obſerv'd a new Star appearing in the time of mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; as if the Heavens ſeem'd by an extraordinary Production to aemu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the new ſplendor of the Earth The young Prince was baptiſed at S. <hi>Iames</hi>'s on the twenty ſeventh of <hi>Iuly</hi> next enſuing by the hand of Dr. <hi>Laud</hi> then biſhop of <hi>London</hi> (Dr. <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> being rendred uncapable by an unhappy accident of ſhooting a man) and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his Father's name, <hi>Charles:</hi> his Godfathers were his two Uncles, <hi>Lewis</hi> the thirteenth, King of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Frederick</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and Prince Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> of the <hi>Rhine;</hi> whoſe abſence occaſioning them to depute their ſubſtitutes, the late Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> repreſented his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58409:7"/>of <hi>France,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> the King of <hi>Bohemia.</hi> His Godmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was <hi>Marta de Medicis,</hi> Queen dowager of <hi>France,</hi> repreſented by the Dutcheſſe of <hi>Richmond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It deſerves our notice, that he was born the greateſt Prince that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver theſe Nations knew; never any before him having been born heir apparent to the Crowns of <hi>England, Scotland, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> which was intimated in the Silver coynes made at the ſolemnity of his Baptiſm, on the reverſe ſide whereof were the Armes of thoſe four Kingdomes with this Motto, <hi>Hactenus Anglorum nulli.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the fourth day of <hi>November,</hi> one thouſand, ſix hundred, thirty one, it pleaſed the Divine Providence to enlarge the Royal Family by the birth of a Daughter, the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> who was afterwards (viz. 2. <hi>May</hi> 1641.) married to <hi>VVilliam</hi> of <hi>Naſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:58409:8"/>Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> by whom ſhe hath a poſthume Son, named <hi>VVil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam:</hi> a Princeſs whoſe perfections qualifi'd her for the bed of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Potentate in Chriſtendome, had not the intereſt of Religion been more conſider'd in her match then amplitude of Territory or Title.</p>
            <p>By the bleſſing of Heaven upon the Royal bed, the King became father to another Son, the moſt illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious and renouned <hi>Iames</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> upon the thirteenth of <hi>October,</hi> in the year One thouſand, ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, thirty three; he was ſolemnly baptiſed on S. <hi>Iames</hi>'s day next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, and within a few dayes after created Duke of <hi>York;</hi> Title born by his Father, during the life of Prince <hi>Henry</hi> his elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>This Prince hath, though yet in his youth, ſo ſignalized himſelf by his valour in the Armies of the Kings
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58409:8"/>of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> that I think this Age (nor perhaps any of old) cannot afford his parallel.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty likewiſe had another Son brought forth to him by his Royal Conſort upon the twentieth day of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1640. who was Chriſtned <hi>Henry,</hi> and created Duke of <hi>Gloceſter:</hi> And a Daughter at <hi>Exceſter,</hi> during the Warres upon the ſixteenth of <hi>Iune</hi> 1644. named after her Royal mother <hi>Henrietta Maria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the ſurviving Iſſue of our late Soveraign of bleſſed memory: And having thus briefly given an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Parentage and Birth of theſe Illuſtrious Princes, I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to repreſent the Life of Him who is particularly the Argument of this Relation, CHARLES Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> now our Soveraign Lord King of Great <hi>Britain, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The care of his <hi>Infancy</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58409:9"/>to the right honourable the Counteſs of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> wife to the laſt Earle; 'till, after ſome yeares, having out-grown female conduct, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Marqueſs of <hi>Newcastle</hi> was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by the King as a fit perſon to imbue his <hi>Youth</hi> with all the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments requiſite to greatneſſe, and the Reverend Dr. <hi>Duppa</hi> Lord Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter</hi> and now of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury,</hi> as one able to form his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mind to true Religion and Virtue.</p>
            <p>Every year of his Childhood af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded new promiſes and hopes, and even in that age, which uſually has not the advantage of diſcretion either totally to ſubdue or at leaſt to diſſemble the motions of paſſions, he expreſs'd on all occaſions an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary goodneſſe and ſweetneſs of nature, ſeeming to have been born with that equal temper of mind, which few men render themſelves
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58409:9"/>capable of by the help of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy and Religion. Nor were his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations to Virtue more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able then thoſe he had to excellent and ſol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d Arts, which the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe of his <hi>Genius</hi> render'd more acceptable to him then the levity of the moſt exquiſite divertiſements.</p>
            <p>In the ninth year of his Age he hapned to break his arme, and was very ſickly, falling firſt into a Feaver and ſhortly after into the Jaundies; but by the favour of the divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, he happily overcame his diſtempers, and afterwards attain'd a firmer health.</p>
            <p>When he came to ſit in the Houſe of Peers (1640<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) his firſt action in publick affairs was the carrying the King's Letter to them, in favour of that noble but unfortunate Lord, the Earl of <hi>Strafford;</hi> the King hoping that when all other reſpects could not prevail upon them, at leaſt the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58409:10"/>conſideration of the dignity and goodneſſe of this Royal Meſſenger might ſomething move them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the hard meaſure they had determin'd for him. But through the cruel fate of this brave man (or rather that of theſe three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes) the heat of I know not what ſtrange zeal had made them ſo thirſty for his bloud, that a day or two's reſpite of execution of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt ſentence that ever was given, was more then could be afforded to the deſires of their King though pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the hands of their Prince. This repulſe he ſuffer'd, was certainly the beginning (if not the cauſe) of all his enſuing ſufferings, and thoſe of the Nation's too. For ſoon after hapned that fatall miſunderſtanding between the King and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: which occaſioning the King's withdrawing from <hi>London,</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Prince to attend him

From thence with the Duke of <hi>York</hi> he accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies his Father to <hi>New-market,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> where they all ſtood before the gates of <hi>Hull</hi> and were deny'd admiſſion by Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham,</hi> 'till at length the two Princely brothers were by his ſpecial favour permitted as children to ſee the Town.</p>
            <p>At <hi>York,</hi> the Northern Nobility and Gentry offering their ſervice to his Majeſty, received thanks for it, but were not made uſe of (for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of jealouſie) 'till a greater danger induc'd the King to neglect his fafety no longer, and accordingly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58409:11"/>he ſelected a company of gallant and loyal perſons for his Life guard, which were commanded by the young Prince; <hi>His Majeſty aſſuring them they ſhould hazard their lives no further in defence of their Countries Lawes and Liberties then himſelf; and that they ſhould endanger themſelves no farther for his perſon then his own dear Child.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this manner he accompanied the King from <hi>York</hi> to <hi>Newark</hi> in <hi>Nottinghamſhire,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and back again into <hi>Yorkſhire:</hi> in which progreſs the King endeavoured to ſatisfie the Counties he paſſed through, of the uprightneſſe of his intentions for the good of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and evidenc'd to them the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate courſes the Parliament enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in order to deprive him of the Royalty left him from his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, and this under pretence of

            </p>
            <p>Not long after, the King having gather'd a conſiderable Army, was met between <hi>Kinton</hi> and <hi>Edge-hill</hi> in <hi>Warwickſhire</hi> by that of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under the conduct of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> There was the firſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable battle fought of our civill Wars. The Prince was then in the field, and the Honourable Earle of <hi>Lindſey</hi> (who was the King's Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and loſt his life in the fight) looking upon him very attentively a little before the conjunction of the Armies. I know not by what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall inſtinct utter'd theſe words,

               <hi>Ther's a Child, born to end that VVar we now begin.</hi> Which how miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly accompliſh't, we cannot but gratefully acknowledge; the civill Wars having continued ever ſince; the Army which had ſubdued the one Party, afterwards turning their ſwords upon thoſe that firſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd them, and the poor Nations being rul'd by the ſword, and always in a ſtate of War, and groaning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the miſeries inflicted on it by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Oppreſſours.</p>
            <p>After this the King retir'd with the Prince to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to the Right Honourable the Marqueſſe of <hi>Hertford,</hi> then and ſtill Chancellor of that Univerſity, who provided for him ſeverall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy perſons in the quality of Tutors for his inſtruction in all ſuch langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Sciences as were conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the accompliſhment of a Prince. During his reſidence there
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58409:12"/>it pleaſed God to viſit him with the Meazles, and that not without ſome danger of death, which by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine mercy and indulgence to theſe Nations he avoided, &amp; is reſpited we hope for many years. Here he was very diligent in commendable ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies intermix'd with ingenious and innocent pleaſures; and upon the King's ſummoning a Parliament thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which convened the 22 of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> 1644. himſelf with his noble Brother the Duke of <hi>York</hi> ſate with the reſt of the Nobility in the Upper Schooles which were deſigned for the Houſe of Lords (as the Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Houſe was to the Commons) who were no inconſiderable number, there being preſent at that Aſſembly, beſides theſe two young Princes, the Lord Keeper <hi>Littleton,</hi> the Lord Treaſurer <hi>Cottington,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> the Marqueſſe of <hi>Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> nineteen Earles, three and

            <p>The next year the Prince betakes himſelf into the field, being now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout fifteen years old; his firſt courſe was Weſtward, where by his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Order he had attendants ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him ſuitable to the grandeur and ſtate of an heir to three Crowns; He ſet up a Royall Court, and choſe out a Retinue at his own pleaſure (the King though diſapproving the action in a Letter to the Queen, yet admiring his diſcretion in the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them) ſcarce inferiour (as a great obſerver affirm'd) to that of his deceaſed Uncle Prince <hi>Henry.</hi> During this time the King of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> ſends over an Embaſſadour, who amongſt ſeverall ſpecious propoſals relating to his Majeſties preſent exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, tenders one for a Marriage between the Daughter of that King and the Prince of <hi>Wales;</hi> which for

            <p>After that fatall battle of <hi>Naſeby.</hi> which turn'd the ſcale to the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Royall Intereſt, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Overtures interven'd between Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> the Lord <hi>Goring,</hi> and the Parliamentarian General <hi>Fairfax;</hi> but the two former al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes receiv'd the ſame anſwer from him, which ſignified nothing, <hi>viz.

            <p>Such were the honourable, loyal, and good intentions of this noble Prince, and ſuch was the inſolence of the Victors, and the fate of this Nation, that no mediation could be acceptable that might prevent its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching totall ruine: ſo that this

            <p>Shortly after the Prince repairs to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and there reconciles his Couſins the Princes, <hi>Rupert</hi> and <hi>Maurice,</hi> to his Father their Uncle. From thence alſo he writes ſeverall Letters to the Speaker of the Houſe of Peers, containing Propoſitions for reconciliation and peace; which notwithſtanding took no effect.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58409:16"/>to check them with thoſe broken Forces he had left, deſires a ceſſation; but the General ſummons him to lay down Armes; upon which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued a Treaty at <hi>Treſilian</hi> Bridge, Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> quartering at <hi>Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> further weſt. ward; between whom it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, upon the thirteenth of <hi>March,</hi>

From hence the Queen being willing to comply with the active deſires of her Son (which inclin'd him to break through theſe clouds of miſery and retirement, which ſeem'd whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to obſcure him) writes to the King by Major <hi>Boſvil,</hi> requeſting him to permit the Prince to go into the field with his Uncle, the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> that ſummer in the head of a <hi>French</hi> Army, that was then deſign'd for an expedition into <hi>Flanders</hi> againſt the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> To which his Majeſty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd to condeſcend, partly for that he judg'd it an imployment below a Prince of Great <hi>Britain</hi> to ſerve any other King but his own, whoſe pay and orders were once receiv'd by a

            <p>In the mean time it pleaſed the King of kings to lay his hand upon him, and viſit him with an intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Fever, which continued upon him for the ſpace of ſome weeks; 'till by the divine bleſſing upon the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian's care, he was recover'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect health.

Whereupon new propoſitions are ſent to him, which the <hi>Scots</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt againſt as too derogatory to his Honour; and therefore they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed.

            <p>For the better ſatisfaction of the World his Highneſſe was pleaſed to publiſh a moſt gracious Declaration which conſiſted of the enſuing Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars: 1. For the eſtabliſhment of Religion according to his Majeſties agreement of the 26. of <hi>December</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:58409:27"/>laſt, <hi>viz. That Presbytery ſhould be continued for Three yeares, and a free debate to be had, between the Divines aſsembled at</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>and twenty whom his Majeſty ſhould appoint, about the ſettlement of Church Government for the future.</hi> 3. For the performance of the ſaid Agreement, and purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the conceſſions on the King's part: (which were, <hi>That the Parliament ſhould diſpoſe of the</hi> Militia, <hi>and have the choice of his privy Counſellors du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Reign,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That the Arrears of the Army be pay'd,</hi> &amp;c. 3. For re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring the King to a perſonal Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. 4. For the juſt Priviledges of Parliament. 5. for an Act of Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion. 6. For the Liberty of the Subject, and the aboliſhing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, Taxes and Free Quarter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 7. For disbanding of all Armies and ſetling of Peace. 8. For the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Narrow Seas, ſecuring of Trade, ſupport of the Navy and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58409:28"/>Seamen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This excellent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration was ſeconded with a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from his Highneſſe to the Houſe of Peers, deſiring, 1. That a Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Treaty be had in ſuch place and manner as may conſiſt with the King's Honour, Safety and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that the Treaty be not ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh'd with any appearance of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint. 2. That <hi>Scotland</hi> be inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. 3. That in the mean time there be a ceſſation of Armes, and an orderly moderate ſubſiſtence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on for Forces on Foot on both ſides by land and ſea, to the Souldiers content and the Subjcts eaſe.</p>
            <p>Hereupon within a ſhort time ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall attempts were made for the King's ſervice. <hi>April</hi> the 9. 1643. the <hi>London</hi> Apprentices made an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, but were ſuppreſt by <hi>Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax</hi> the next day. Soon after Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Poyer,</hi> and Major General <hi>Laug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn,</hi> and <hi>Powel,</hi> revolted, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58409:28"/>
               <hi>South-wales</hi> to his Majeſties ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Sir <hi>Iohn Owen</hi> alſo got together a party: but they were all routed and enforced to ſurrender the places they had ſeis'd, and themſelves priſoners. In behalf of the two former, the Prince, under whoſe Commiſſion they acted, deſired Generall <hi>Fairfax</hi> that they might have the terms and uſage of ſouldiers of war, as thoſe had whom the fortune of war had made priſoners to his Highneſſe. But the General anſwer'd, <hi>It was not in his power to act further; the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ordering their tryal, he dar'd not interpoſe against their juſtice.</hi> So that they were afterwards tryed as Traytor's; but this favour was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended towards them that they ſhould caſt lots for their lives: it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be <hi>Poyer</hi>'s fate to ſuffer, and he was ſhot to death, which he took with much reſolution.</p>
            <p>The next party we meet with in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58409:29"/>Armes for the King's deliverance out of a barbarous captivity, and admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to a perſonal Treaty, and the ſettlement of the Nation in peace, were the inhabitants of <hi>Kent,</hi> who having ſeen the Petitions preſented to that purpoſe to the Parliament by the Counties of <hi>Eſſex, Surrey,</hi> and the City of <hi>London</hi> ſlighted, and ſome of the Petitioners murder'd, reſolved not to petition but with their ſwords in their hands. So they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble together in a conſiderable body upon <hi>Black-heath</hi> near <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> about the latter end of <hi>May</hi> 1648. under Sir <hi>Edward Hales,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned from his Highneſſe, Sir <hi>George Liſle,</hi> Sir <hi>Gamaliel Dudley,</hi> Sir <hi>William Compton, &amp;c.</hi> I ſhall crave leave to be a little more particular in relating the whole management of this and ſome of the following en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes, then I have adventured to be hitherto, becauſe it was carried
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58409:29"/>on by authority deriv'd immediately from the Prince, and was of it ſelf one of the moſt conſiderable.

They had not the Originals of the Princes Letters and Declaration (which the Common Council ſtill kept) but only Copies, not ſo much as atteſted upon Oath by any authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Clerk; therefore no legall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings could be upon them. 2. It world argue no peaceable inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in them the ſame day when they ſent Meſſengers to invite the King his Father to a Treaty of Peace. 3. It could not conſiſt with the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Covenant. 4. It is High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by the Stat. 25. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the deſtruction of the Prince, the King's eldeſt Son: but to declare him a Rebel and a Traytor was to endeavour to deſtroy him, and therefore High Treaſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58409:34"/>what they could not do expreſly, they did implicitely by Voting all that ſhould adhere to, aid or aſſiſt the Prince, Rebels and Traytors. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they put a tye upon the City, not to redeem their ſhips by lending 20000. <hi>l.</hi> to the Prince; and yet had a Pyrate taken them, it had been law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to redeem them. About this time alſo an Order paſſed the Houſe of Commons for the Earl of <hi>VVar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick to fight the Prince at ſea.</hi> It was ſent up to the Lords, and paſſed that Houſe too; whereby it became an Ordinance: yet ſome of the Lords entred a Proteſtation againſt it, as the Earles of <hi>Lincoln, Suffolk,</hi> Lord <hi>North.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prince continued ſtill in the <hi>Downes</hi> with his Fleet in a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, waiting for that ſupply of Land forces his Brother the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was very induſtriouſly rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing for his ſervice in <hi>Holland,</hi> and in
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58409:34"/>the <hi>interim</hi> was willing to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the relief of <hi>Deal</hi> Caſtle, which was beſieged by a party of <hi>Fairfax</hi>'s Army left in <hi>Kent</hi> for that purpoſe. In order to which he land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 500. men, who at firſt charged handſomely, but being overpowr'd by number were beaten, ſeveral ſlain and taken, and the reſt got a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board again. Failing of this attempt, he was inclinable to hazard himſelf for the relief of <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> which bravely held out againſt <hi>Fairfax</hi>'s whole power; but from this he was diſſwadeded, as a buſineſſe of too ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent danger. Wherefore he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued expecting the event of <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s expedition in the North, who was ſent into <hi>England</hi> by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Scotland</hi> with an Army of 21000. upon the account of the Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> for a reſtitution of his Majeſty with ſafety and honour, and ſettlement of <hi>Presbyterie.</hi> On
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58409:35"/>the 15. day of <hi>Iuly,</hi> the Houſe of Commons (without the Lords) Vote the <hi>Scots</hi> that were come into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> enemies, and that they might covertly include the Prince, the Queſtion was put, That all ſuch <hi>Engliſh</hi> as had invited the <hi>Scots</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> to come in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile manner into <hi>England</hi> ſhould be declared Traitors? and carried in the affirmative.</p>
            <p>He that ſhall conſider the Houſe of Commons was ſtill in a manner entire, and conſiſted of the very ſame men that ſo often and by ſo many Votes, Remonſtrances, Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, Proteſtations, Vowes and Oaths pretended the defence of the King's perſon and juſt authority, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of theſe Nations in purity of Religion and preſervation of the juſt Rights and Liberties of the Subject (the very ſame things now petition'd for by ſeveral Counties, &amp; declared
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58409:35"/>for by the parties up in <hi>Kent</hi> &amp; <hi>Eſsex,</hi> and Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> in the North) cannot but wonder they ſhould vote them Traitors and endeavour their deſtruction (with that of the Nations conſequently) who took up armes in the greateſt ſincerity poſſible for thoſe honourable purpoſes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alledged to countenance their own againſt the King. But the truth is the two Houſes ſate under a force ever ſince <hi>Auguſt</hi> 6. 1647. when <hi>Fairfax</hi> march't up with his Army in hoſtile manner againſt the City. For from that time the leſſer party of the Houſe (who together with ſome Officers of the Army had layd the blackeſt deſign that ever was hatcht by the inſtinct of the Devil) ſiding with the Army over-aw'd all the Proceedings of Parliament, and at the ſame time held the King and the major part of the Houſe in ſuſpence with unfaithfull Treaties, and ſent
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:58409:36"/>their forces againſt ſuch as deſir'd the ſame things they would be believ'd themſelves intended. The Houſe of Lords too, being ſtrangely ſupine, in not reſenting the frequent ſleighting and contempt of their Authority, and not attempting any thing at all for the deliverance of their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, the Vindication of their own Honour, that of the Nation with it's rights, priviledges and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, againſt the Uſurpation of an Army and corrupt faction in that of the Commons. An inſolence which I am perſwaded, none of their great Anceſtors we find in Hiſtories under the ſame Titles, but would have ventur'd both lives and fortunes to the utmoſt, rather then have endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and certainly their poſterity will wonder what they were doing all this while. The Earle of <hi>Holland</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, though no Souldier, yet dar'd well, and out of a ſenſe of Honour
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:58409:36"/>thought himſelf oblig'd to try his fortune in the Field, if poſſible he might be an Inſtrument to avert the Deſtruction he ſaw threatned his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, and the miſeries of tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie impendent over this poor Nation by an armed power. By commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Prince he aſſembles together about 500. Horſe and Foot about <hi>Kingston</hi> heath, <hi>Iuly</hi> 2. having with him the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and his Brother, the L. <hi>Francis Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Peterborough.</hi> But he was ſoon routed by a ſtronger Party; himſelf taken, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards put to death for his noble but unfortunate Attempt. Such were the ſinnes of this Nation, and thus the good Providence of God was pleaſed to bring about the puniſhment of them, by fruſtrating all meanes and courſes taken to deliver it from the miſeries of that threatned it. For ſoon after, <hi>viz. Auguſt</hi> 17.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58409:37"/>the great Army under <hi>Hamilton</hi> is defeated by <hi>Cromwell</hi> and <hi>Lambert</hi> at <hi>Preſton</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and the Duke himſelf taken, and afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament for this action. This Defeat was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the ſurrender of <hi>Colcheſter</hi> which had indur'd a ſharp ſtarving Siege of three moneths upon hopes of relief from this <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Army. Thus all the Princes Enterpriſes fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and his Fleet being in great need of proviſion, he is forced to give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver further Action, and retires to the <hi>Hague</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> to his Siſter the Princeſſe of <hi>Orange</hi> in expectation and attendance upon Providence. Shortly after, many Counties of <hi>England</hi> ſoliciting the Parliament for a Treaty with the King, the honeſter and greater part take heart again, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call the Votes of Non-Addreſſes, Vote a Treaty, ſend Commiſſioners with Propoſitions to the King: All

But, alas! now begin the greateſt of our woes. The Army who could not think their greatneſs and power would be durable if the King liv'd, draw nearer to <hi>London,</hi> petition for their Arrears, and for Juſtice upon the King as the Capitall cauſe of the Evils of the Civil War; to which effect alſo they publiſh a Remonſtrance, requiring withall that a peremptory Day be ſet for ſummoning the Prince of <hi>VVales,</hi> and Duke of <hi>York;</hi> and if they refuſe, to declare them incapable of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment or ſucceſſion, and to ſtand exiled as Traytors; and if they ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelves, yet they to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded againſt for ſatisfaction: with
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58409:38"/>other damands of the like ſtrain. To bring their accurſed deſign to paſſe, <hi>Fairfax</hi> commands Colonel <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> to deliver up his charge to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Ewer,</hi> by whom the King is conveyed out of the Iſle of <hi>VVight</hi> to <hi>Hurſt</hi> Caſtle, <hi>Novemb.</hi> 30. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the intentions and conſent of the Parliament as they declar'd. And thus the Treaty was violenty bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off. Yet the Lords Vote the King's conceſſions a ſufficient ground for Peace, and ſo do the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor part of the Commons. But the Army march up to <hi>London,</hi> diſcharge the Trained Bands from guarding the Parliament, and order <hi>Pride</hi>'s and <hi>Rich</hi>'s Regiments to ſupply their places, by whom above fourty Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are ſeiz'd on and confin'd, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor General <hi>Brown,</hi> ninety odde Members, excluded the Houſe. Then the Army form a new Model of Government which they ſtile <hi>The
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58409:38"/>Agreement of the people,</hi> deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to all the Fundamental Laws of the Land, which was preſented to the new molded Houſe by Sir <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dres VValler</hi> and 16. Officers. The Houſe hereupon annull the Votes againſt Non-addreſſes, and exclude all Members that will not joyn with them in this proceeding. They then proceed to order the Tryall of the King, and remove him, though the Lords refus'd to concurre, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare no act of the Commons bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without their conſent. However force overcomes all Right &amp; Reaſon. A pretended High Court of Iuſtice is erected, of which <hi>Iohn Bradſhaw</hi> (newly created Serjeant at Law) is made Preſident. The King is brought before them upon Saturday the 20 of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1648. on Monday the 22. on Tueſday the 23. and on Saturday the 27. of the ſame moneth; where perſiſting with magnanimity and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

            <p>But the Royal Party was ſo totally ſuppreſt throughout this Nation, that they wanted power to make good what their conſciences aſſur'd them was juſt and right. This endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour teſtifi'd their Loyalty, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all their weakneſſe. For though the hearts of moſt of the Nation were as

Indeed <hi>Ireland</hi> was in a manner wholly for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, in many places whereof he was by joynt conſent both of Proteſtants and Papiſts proclaimed King. The Lord Marqueſſe of <hi>Ormond,</hi> the Lord <hi>Inchequin,</hi> and other great perſons had conſiderable Forces in the field for his intereſt, and all the Garriſons of that Iſland held out for him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the two moſt important, the Cities of <hi>Dublin</hi> and <hi>London-Derry,</hi> which were kept from returning to their Allegiance, the former by Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant General <hi>Iones</hi> then Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and the latter by Sir <hi>Charles Coot,</hi> who maintain'd their cauſe and authority who had barbarouſly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd his Royal Father in <hi>England.</hi> Beſides the Iſlands of <hi>Ierſey, Guern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,

The Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as I ſaid, had proteſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the proceedings of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> againſt their common King: But at this time that Nation was divided into four grand Factions or Parties. 1.

They were willing though upon certain conditions to own and declare Prince <hi>Charles</hi> for their King; only
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:58409:44"/>in this they ſided with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent <hi>Iuncto,</hi> That they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to the utmoſt to depreſſe and diſcountenance the Malignants (as they called thoſe who had adher'd to his late Majeſty) who make up the ſecond party. The third conſiſted of ſuch as were ſo ſtrictly devoted to the <hi>Kirk</hi> and Convenant, that they only projected the advancement of them, and car'd not for any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt either of <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Free-State,</hi> but ſtrenuouſly oppos'd both; of which Faction Colonel <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

The fourth, and laſt, and worſt were ſuch as by unparallel'd treachery to their Prince, their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Countrey, and (as it appear'd afterwards) to themſelves too, held ſecret correſpondence with the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctarian power and Army of <hi>England.</hi> This Diviſion I have made will give much light to the underſtanding of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:58409:44"/>the reaſons of the Scottiſh actions and their conſequences, when we come to relate them. At preſent, it may ſuffice to intimate that this Diſcord among themſelves retarded them from publickly proclaiming and owning their lawfull King.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the King having been a while a cloſe Mourner in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and receiv'd the condolements of the Lords States, (who alſo depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an Oratour Dr. <hi>Lotius</hi> to repreſent their ſad ſence of the inhumane mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his Royall Father, which he performed in an elegant Latine Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion extant in Print he committed the management of his affairs there to the care of his Brother and Siſter of <hi>Orange;</hi> and took a journey to <hi>France,</hi> both to viſit his diſconſolate and forlorne Mother and to deſire the aſſiſtance, which he might reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably conceive, that King oblig'd both in honour, conſideration of

He was receiv'd in the French Court with much reſpect, and after a ſhort ſtay at <hi>Paris</hi> took up his abode at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> having his Royall Brother the Duke of <hi>York</hi> with him.</p>
            <p>He had not been long here, but contrary to the expectation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> as well as hopes of himſelf and all his Loyall Subjects, news is brought him of the defeat of the Army in <hi>Ireland</hi> under the <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Ormond,</hi> then which a gallanter &amp; richer had ſcarce been ſeen during all the late Warrs. The Marquis had laid ſiege to <hi>Dublin</hi> on the 21. of <hi>Iune</hi> 1649. but that City being reinforc'd with a ſupply of 3000. Horſe and Foot from <hi>England,</hi> and encouraged with the expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of more, the Beſieged made ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Sallies out upon them from time to time, and at length in one ſuppris'd
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:58409:45"/>the <hi>Marquis</hi>'s maine Army, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally defeated it, himſelf not without much difficulty eſcaping by flight. 'Tis very true, the <hi>Marquis</hi> had an Army of about 20000. men, but the greateſt part of them were <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and ſo ſuch as he dar'd not truſt; beſides, I have heard it creadibly reported, He might have taken <hi>Dublin</hi> if he had pleas'd, but forbore to doe it meerly in tenderneſſe to the numerous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants were in it, whom the <hi>Iriſh</hi> would have without queſtion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifully deſtroy'd if they had taken the place by aſſualt; and as yet there was no other way to take it, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the beſieged had high expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuccour from <hi>England.</hi> This was the firſt blow receiv'd by the young King, and a great one it was indeed, and ſo important that it made way for the loſſe of all that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. About the ſame time alſo Sir <hi>Ch. Coot</hi> iſſued out of <hi>London-Derry,</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:58409:46"/>and beat off Sir <hi>Rob. Stuart</hi> and Col. <hi>Mervin</hi> that beſieg'd it. And imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon this ſucceſſe <hi>Ol.

The Royall Field. Army being loſt, <hi>Cromwell</hi> falls upon the Garriſons; the firſt place he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taqued was <hi>Droghedah</hi> (or <hi>Tredagh</hi>) which he ſoon took by ſtorme, and with a cruelty unknown ſince the firſt riſe of Chriſtianity, put the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour Sir <hi>Arthur Aston</hi> (a noble Gentleman that had ſerv'd the late King in <hi>England</hi>) and all Inhabitants of the Town of all ages and ſexes to the Sword. Thus was Providence pleas'd to ſuffer wickedneſſe to proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. This ſucceſſe was follow'd with the loſſe of many conſiderable Townes and Caſtles in all parts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> beſides ſerverall Field-battels obtain'd over the Lords <hi>Inchequin,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58409:46"/>Ardes</hi> and <hi>Clanduboys,</hi> and Lieut. Gen. <hi>Farrell</hi> by the L. <hi>Broghill,</hi> Sir <hi>Ch. Coot,</hi> Col. <hi>Venables, Zanchy, Renolds</hi> and <hi>Hewſon.</hi> So that in leſſe then the ſpace of this year that Kingdome was wholly loſt, which in the beginning of it, his Majeſtie lookt upon as ſo conſiderably his own that he was almoſt perſwaded to have gone thither in perſon; but waved upon mature advice, and went to the Iſle of <hi>Ierſey,</hi> where he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by the Iſlanders immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the L. <hi>Iermin</hi> Earle of <hi>Yar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> was made Governour and Sir <hi>Geo. Carteret</hi> his Deputy. His retinue at his arrivall in this place amounted to about 300. perſons. A little before his departue from St. <hi>Germains,</hi> the Duke of <hi>York</hi> came to him out of <hi>Holland,</hi> &amp; was viſited by the French King and the Cardinal, of whom he humbly implored ayd in behalf of his Brother. <hi>Mazarini</hi> anſwer'd ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:58409:47"/>that he might aſſure himſelf of all favour and aſſiſtance from the King of <hi>France</hi> as ſoon as he had the power and opportunity to ſerve him: In the mean time the Duke is perſented with 100000. Crownes. From <hi>Ierſey</hi> his Majeſty ſends his Summons to <hi>Guernſey</hi> (which was wholly the Parliament's, ſaving <hi>Cornet</hi> Caſtle) to ſubmit to his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. But it was to no effect. It is reported by ſome his Majeſty had ſome expectation from the Level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, who at that time had revolted from the reſt of the Parliament's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: but whatever their deſigne was, they were ſuppreſt both in the Weſt and at <hi>Burford</hi> in <hi>Oxfordſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Engliſh Plantations in the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> at this time under the Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> of <hi>Parham</hi> refus'd Obedience and Subjection to the Parliament, who thereupon firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicted them all Traffick &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58409:47"/>and ſhortly after reduc'd them with a Fleet ſent from <hi>England</hi> under the Command of Sir <hi>Geo. Ayſcough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King at <hi>Ierſey</hi> receiving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of theſe unfortunate ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes following one upon the neck of another, his chief hopes and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations lay now in <hi>Scotland.</hi> He un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the ſeverall Factions there, and that the <hi>Covenanters</hi> who were moſt conſiderable both for Power and Number, ſought their own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by him, and would cauſe much difficulty in his affairs there; wherefore to balance them a little by the honeſt Royaliſts who were his and had been his Father's friends, and whom the former endevour'd to keep under, as alſo to bring them to more equitable Termes, he gives Commiſſion to the noble and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Lord Marquis of <hi>Montroſse</hi> to raiſe forces for him in <hi>Holland</hi> and

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That his Majesty would ſign the ſolemn League and Covenant, and paſs an Act for all perſons to take it throughout that Kingdome, and ratifie all that had been done concerning the ſame.</hi>

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:58409:49"/>to the King to the ſame purpoſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring his Majeſty <hi>to hearken to the Scots Commiſsioners, ſo as to admit of an Agreement with them which might ſettle his Majeſty in that Kingdome with ſafety and Honour;</hi> adding, <hi>That, as for himſelf, he ſhould be contented to be baniſhed perpetually from his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country rather then be the least cauſe of prejudice to his Majestie's af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires.</hi> Thus this incomparable pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of Loyaltie preferred the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of his Prince above all reſpects of his own. But his Majeſtie was too generous to admit of his offer, and therefore anſwered him, <hi>That he had ſuch aſſurance of his fidelity &amp; ſo high a ſenſe of his ſervices perform'd to his late Father and himſelf that he could not in Iuſtice or in Honour deſert him, and therefore deſired him to urge him no further to it.</hi> At length the advice to cloſe with the <hi>Scots</hi> ſeem'd moſt ſafe and reaſonable, and proceeding
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:58409:50"/>from the greater number of ſuffrages, it was reſolv'd to follow it. The next thing therefore to be delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated of, was what anſwer ſhould be return'd to the Propoſitions; which requiring ſome time, Sir <hi>VVill.

            <p>The New Commonwealth in <hi>England</hi> in the mean time was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell'd thus. The Houſe of Peers as I ſaid was voted down, the Commons reduc'd to about 100; and a new kind of Senate ſet up, called a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of State, who ſate at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> conſiſting of forty perſons; theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, though deriv'd from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, grew to have greater autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity then their creators; but though the ſupreme Power ſeem'd in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to be in theſe two Councils yet it was really in the hands of the Army, the chief Officers of which
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:58409:50"/>rul'd them that rul'd the Nations. Their principall buſineſs at Home was to fortify their new Government by making ſeverall Acts of Treaſon, and to terrifie others by putting to death divers of the Nobility as D. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton,</hi> E. of <hi>Holland,</hi> L. <hi>Capel,</hi> &amp;c. and ſuch of the Gentry who had oppos'd their Barbarous and Tyrannicall Proceedings. They alſo employ'd themſelves in dividing the Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Crown, having murder'd the Father and expell'd the Son; the ſame courſe alſo they took with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands of loyall perſons, either confiſcating and ſelling their Eſtates, or putting them to redeem the ſame upon great compoſitions; by this meanes and prodigious Taxes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, drawing all the Wealth of the Nation, both Money &amp; Lands, into their own hands, and ſharing the ſame among themſelves &amp; their Lords the Officers of the Army.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:58409:51"/>His Majeſty had ſmall hopes of doing any good immediately upon <hi>England,</hi> although he had friends e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in it.

            <p>The King had ſent Ambaſſadours to ſeverall great Princes and States, as the Emperor, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> the State of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> the Grand Seignor, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to ſollicite their ayd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution for the recovery of his Father's Kingdomes.

            <p>After the reading of theſe Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and the Letters his Majeſtie being told theſe were all their inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, anſwered; That he would take theſe things into conſideration, and doubted not to give them ſuch a full anſwer, as ſhould give them &amp; his Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> ample ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
            <p>His Majeſtie and his Council deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate very ſeriouſly upon theſe Heads of the Treaty.

            </p>
            <p>Theſe conditions were ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hard, but the poſture his Majeſtie's affairs then ſtood in ſeem'd to moſt of his Counſellours to afford an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible argument to perſwade him to accept them. The Marquis of <hi>Montroſſe,</hi> as I ſaid, was commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd by the King to levy what force he could on that ſide the Sea and to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:58409:60"/>fall into the North of <hi>Scotland,</hi> upon hopes his appearance there might induce the States to more modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In order to which he had ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> for aſſiſtance, but he received little more from any but promiſes and complements. Onely from the Duke of <hi>Holſtein</hi> he was ſupplyed with three or four very fair Veſſels well arm'd and amn'd. And to expedite his buſineſſe he diſpatcht Col. <hi>Iohn Ogilby</hi> to <hi>Amſterdam</hi> to intertain ſuch ſtrangers as might be for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. But the forgetting his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, beſtow'd both money &amp; paines in intertaining himſelf, ſuffering thoſe who upon any termes would have engag'd to ſhift for themſelves; there being a great number who had fled out of <hi>England,</hi> and more who had lately deſerted the <hi>French,</hi> or been caſhiered the <hi>Hollander</hi>'s ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. By which neglect thoſe goodly
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:58409:60"/>ſhips provided for ſervice were loſt, and a limb of the deſign broken. Nor was this the onely miſcarriage that hapned in the beginning of the <hi>Marquis</hi>'s enterpriſe. For Col. <hi>Cochran</hi> likewiſe who had been ſent into <hi>Poland</hi> to deal with the <hi>Scotch</hi> Merchants there for aſſiſtance, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving procured very conſiderable Summes of money upon that ſcore and other proviſion, diſpos'd of the money to his own uſe, made ſale of the Corn and proviſion together tranſportation of it, and himſelf turn'd tail to the quarrell. And Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>King</hi> (whom the <hi>Marquis</hi> expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of <hi>Sweden</hi> with a conſiderable party of Horſe) either could not be ready ſo ſoon as was expected, or elſe delay'd on purpoſe. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the Marqueſſe fearing (as is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd) he ſhould have an expreſſe command to deſiſt from his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:58409:61"/>becauſe the Treaty betwixt his Majeſty and the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners was likely to come to a ſpeedy concluſion, whereby himſelf ſhould be baniſht out of that Kingdome, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally reſolves to proceed, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all difficulties. So he ſet forth for the conqueſt of a Nation ſettled in a poſture of war, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn'd of his intentions, with about ſix or ſeven hundred men at moſt, ſtrangers and all, about the tenth of <hi>April</hi> 1650.

This was another check and a forerunner of the ſad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent which follow'd. However no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing terrifi'd with theſe unhappy preſages, he arriv'd himſelf at the Iſle of <hi>Orkney,</hi> having with him ſeverall <hi>Scotch</hi> Gentlemen reſolv'd to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of his fortune. Here he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a conſiderable time to raiſe ſuch forces and recruits as the place would afford, which were poor, raw, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>train'd fellowes, making up the ſhew of an Army, but wholly ignorant of war. With theſe he embarques and lands at <hi>Cathanes</hi> the fartheſt point to the <hi>Northweſt</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the coming of two thouſand men rais'd in the Earle of <hi>Seaforth</hi>'s Territories.

And laſtly, exhorted all Subjects of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to endeavour to free themſelves from the Tyranny of thoſe who for the preſent ruled the ſtate, and from the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:58409:62"/>of the Miniſtry.</hi> But the Countrey, partly through fear of the danger, and partly being over-awed by the Earle of <hi>Sunderland,</hi> did not come to ſecond him as he expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Straughan</hi> who commanded a choice party of Horſe, advances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Leſley</hi>'s body, whilſt the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe had effected nothing material beſides the taking of <hi>Dumbath</hi> Caſtle. Upon <hi>Straughan</hi>'s approach, a party of 100. were drawn forth, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred his Forlorn hope, and put them to retreat; but being immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſeconded by <hi>Straughan</hi>'s whole body, who charged upon that of the Marqueſſe, the Iſlanders threw down their Armes and were diſpers'd; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Dutch</hi> Forces made an orderly retreat into ſome ſhrubs hard by, where having very valiantly defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves a while, they were at laſt enforced to yield. This was a totall Defeat: of 1200. which were
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:58409:63"/>in the field on the Marqueſſe's ſide, 200. were ſlain, and all the reſt taken, ſaving about a hundred who eſcaped by flight. Among the Priſoners of note were Major General Sir <hi>Iohn Vrrey,</hi> the Lord <hi>Frendraught,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Hay</hi> of <hi>Dalketie,</hi> Colonel <hi>Hay</hi> of <hi>Naughton,</hi> Colonel <hi>Grey,</hi> Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Colonel <hi>Stuart,</hi> with a great number of other conſiderable offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and two Miniſters. The Royal Standard was alſo taken, in which was pourtrayed the Head of the late King, lying a bleeding, and ſevered from the body, with this Motto, IUDGE AND REVENGE MY CAUSE, O LORD. The Marqueſſe himſelf when he ſaw the day loft, threw away his Cloak which had the Star on it (having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the order of the Garter a little while before) deſerted his horſe, changed his habit with a <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:58409:63"/>was ſo welcome to the State and Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that they rewarded <hi>Straughan</hi> with 1000. <hi>l. sterling,</hi> and gratifi'd other officers.

But his adverſity and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed reward made him now be lookt upon under another notion, ſo that either out of fear or covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or both, this Lord ſends this Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious but unfortunate Heroe with a ſtrong guard to <hi>David Leſley,</hi> by whom he was forthwith ſent to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> into which he was carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all the ignominy, malice, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted

They put him into a high ſeat in faſhion of a Chariot, and bound him about the breaſt and armes with a cord into a Chair. The Executioner (being ſo commanded) took off the Marqueſſe his hat, and the chariot being drawn with four horſes, put on his own bonnet, mounted one of the firſt horſes, and ſo very ſolemnly drive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the <hi>Tol booth.</hi> He had at that time many wounds about him, but none uncurable. The Parliament had reſolv'd before-hand what ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to pronounce upon him; but the more to diſgrace him and to act with formality and inſolence. He was brought before them, where he

            <q>
               <p>SIR,</p>
               <p>I am commanded to mind you of the laſt judgement of <hi>God</hi> befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len you for your perfidious break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> which might juſtly provoke <hi>God</hi> thus to divert your counſels and affairs, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been ſo eminent an Author and Actor of miſchief againſt this Nation. You abandoned the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> and deſpiſed the <hi>Oath of God,</hi> invaded your Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and with moſt inhumane and barbarous cruelty burnt and waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt divers parts thereof, and have ſpilt much blood of his Majeſtie's good Subjects, taking advantage of that time when the prime Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:58409:65"/>&amp; forces thereof were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd elſewhere. For theſe Crimes you were excommunicated by the Church, and ſore-faulted by the <hi>Parliament</hi> of this Kingdome, and yet ſtill continued in the higheſt contempt againſt God under that fearfull ſentence of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; And to this day have you remained without the leaſt ſhew of Repentance. And <hi>God</hi> by his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> hath now juſtly brought you hither to receive the Sentence of your Condemnation.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Hereunto the Illuſtrious Priſoner, having defir'd and obtain'd liberty, anſwer'd,</p>
            <p>My Lord, <hi>I am glad that I may to anſwer for my ſelf. Though I am here your priſoner, yet my cauſe is good; Nor is there any breach of the Covenant on my part, in which I ſwore to be true to his Majestie, his Heirs and Succeſſors. Concerning what I
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:58409:66"/>have done in relation to the VVars &amp; affairs of this Kingdome, I had not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a General Commiſsion, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Orders for what I have done from his Majesty, which I was engag'd to obey by the ſaid</hi> Covenant. <hi>And concerning my coming over now, I was aſſertain'd that you had profeſt to comply with his Majeſty in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Affairs in which he hath employ'd me; and upon that Account it was that I have acted. I deſire to refer my ſelf, and to ſubmit unto this preſent</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>and the authority thereof to be my Iudges in this Caſe, whom I own as a true Parliament by authority from his Majeſty; and I ſhall be content, however it ſhall pleaſe God to deal with me. As for my Life, if you take it away by this Authority, it is well known to the VVorld I regard it not: Death is a debt which all owe, and must once be pay'd by every one; And I ſhall be willing and much rejoice to goe the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:58409:66"/>ſame way which my Maſter paſs'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me; and it is the joy of my heart not onely to do, but alſo to ſuffer for him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After he had pronounced this with a very compoſed gravity, even to the admiration of all that heard him, he was commanded to withdraw. The <hi>Parliament</hi> were not long in debate, but unanimouſly reſolv'd upon this Sentence of Condemnation, which, he being recall'd, was pronounc'd againſt him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You are to be carried back to the place from whence you came, and from thence to morrow being the</hi> 21. <hi>of</hi> May (1650.) <hi>to</hi> Edenburgh <hi>Croſſe, there to be hanged on a Gallowes</hi> 30. <hi>foot high for the ſpace of</hi> 3. <hi>hours, with your History &amp; Declaration about your neck, and then to be taken down, and your head cut off upon the Scaffold, and ſet upon</hi> Edenburgh <hi>Talbooth, and your legs and armes over the gates of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

            </p>
            <p>This ſentence aggravated by the Chancellor in the utmoſt terms of horrour his ſpleen could invent, was undiſmaiedly receive d by the noble Marqueſſe, who anſwered, <hi>That he took it for a greater to have his head ſtand on the Priſon gate for this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, then to have his P cture in the King's Bed-chamber. And leaſt his Loyalty ſhould be forgotten, they had highly honoured him in deſigning laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing monuments to bear up his memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to all posterity; wiſhing he had fleſh enough to have ſent a piece to every Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Chriſtendome to witneſse his Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty to his King and Countrey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day, having prepar'd his ſoul for Heaven, he marcht ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnanimouſly to the Scaffold, and

            <p>Thus dyed this incomparable <hi>Marquis</hi> of immortal fame, a great example of unfortunate Virtue, whoſe barbarous murder, I have more particularly related, becauſe it diſcovers the temper of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted party who put him to death. Poſterity certainly will eſteem his memory, and account his Iudges de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving a more exquiſite puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for this and other their inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane actions then that they inflicted on him, if it be poſſible for the quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence of malice to invent a greater.</p>
            <p>Within a few dayes after four o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Noble Gentlemen ſuffer'd for

            <p>Such was the fate of his Majeſtie's affairs in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the brave per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that manag'd them; and ſuch was the unparallel'd inſolence of the <hi>Scots,</hi> who dar'd to murther his beſt friends, while they were in Treaty with him, upon a baſe and ungene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous preſumption, that the lowneſſe of his condition would enforce him to put up patiently ſo high and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable an indignity. Which indeed, he was conſtrain'd to doe, as his affairs then ſtood. When the newes was brought to his Majeſty at <hi>Breda,</hi> he was much ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rtled at it, and expreſt his Reſentment of their proceedings by a Meſſage ſent them by Mr. <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey</hi> 
               <q>That he was griev'd to hear it
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:58409:68"/>credibly reported that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thoſe hopefull overtures of Peace lately made between him and them, they had ſhed the blood of ſome of his beſt Subjects of the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and that the manner thereof according to Reports did extremely trouble him. But that he might underſtand the Particulars more certainly he deſir'd an account of the buſineſs from themſelves.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In anſwer to this they profeſs'd <hi>their affections were ſtill reall to him, and their Hearts much joy'ed to hear of his willingneſs to concur with them in a happy agreement;</hi> And deſir'd him <hi>not to ſtumble at ſome ſeeming Obſtacles, as the Death of Montroſſe, or their reducing of his Forces;</hi> Aſſuring him there was nothing in what they did, but to accompliſh his Ends and promote his Intereſts to his beſt Advantage. (This zealous
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58409:69"/>Nation do's God and the King good ſervice, when they illegally and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanely murder their fellow-Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and Subjects.)</p>
            <p>Theſe actions of the <hi>Scots</hi> and the buſineſs of the Covenant were the main impediments of the Treaty. But the murder of <hi>Montroſſe</hi> though it might juſtly have deterr'd his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty from truſting himſelf into thoſe hands which reak'd with his beſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants Blood, could not be redreſs'd; and his neceſſities enforc'd him to diſſemble all further reſentment of it. As for the <hi>Covenant,</hi> he argu'd <hi>that it was the Subjects Covenant to bind them to their King, and not for him to ſwear to; and therefore he thought it ſufficient to paſſe an Act for his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to take it.</hi> He likewiſe offered to confirme the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Scotland; Provided that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf might have alwaies three Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines of his own Election; As alſo to

The newes whereof being carry'd to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> the <hi>Parliament</hi> forthwith met, and the fourth Faction which I mention'd, viz. ſuch as correſponded with the Sectarian <hi>Iunto</hi> of <hi>England</hi> were ſo ſtrangely and ridiculouſly impudent as to put it to the Vote, <hi>whether any more Adddreſses ſhould be made to the King</hi> (it ſeemed they deſir'd to ape the abominable Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters at <hi>Westminſter,</hi> who paſs'd a Vote of Non addreſſes after his late Majeſty had conſented to all their demands) there were 32. of theſe malevolent Negatives, but the major part carried it in the Affirmative.

            <p>After this they betook themſelves to make preparations for his Rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, Two of the chiefeſt Houſes in <hi>Edenburgh</hi> were richly furniſht, and the Parliament took into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the nominating Officers for his Majeſties Houſehold, which they
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:58409:71"/>did with much arrogance, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting thoſe to wait upon him whom he chiefly favoured, &amp; whom he judg'd beſt affected towards him, and by Proclamation prohibiting ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall great Scotch Lords, as Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Louderdale</hi> and <hi>S aforth,</hi> with many other perſons of Quality who had conſtantly attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on him in <hi>Ierſey</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> from returning into <hi>Scotland.</hi>

               <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhips which ply'd about the Coaſt to way-lay him; but with ſome difficulty he eſcaped both, and arrived ſafe at a place called the <hi>Spey</hi> in the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whither ſome Lords were ſent to receive and accompany him to <hi>Edenburgh.</hi> All the way he was entertain'd with the generall joy and acclamations of the people. At <hi>Dundee</hi> new Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were by Commiſſioners from the <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>Kirk</hi> preſented to him to ſign, which after ſome relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy he performed.

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:58409:72"/>of Estates</hi> and Parliament conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about forming of an Army for his ſervice as they pretended, and an Act was paſs'd for training every fourth man capable to bear Armes through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Kingdom, &amp; raiſing 16000. Foot and 6000. Horſe; in which the Earle of <hi>Leven</hi> was made General of the Foot, <hi>Holborn</hi> Major General, <hi>David Leſley</hi> Lieutenant General of the Horſe, and <hi>Montgomery</hi> Major General; the ſupreme Command being reſerv'd for his Majeſty.

As for himſelf, he had a ſtrong Guard continually about him to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him and obſerve his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>The Engliſh pretended Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had all this while ſufficient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of the <hi>Scots</hi> proceedings with his Majeſty in the Treaty of <hi>Breda,</hi> together with their engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to aſſiſt him in the recovery of his Rights in <hi>England,</hi> and this by the perfidiouſneſſe &amp; treachery of ſome of the Fourth Faction I mention'd in the Parliament of <hi>Scotland.</hi> And therefore by the ſollicitation of theſe Traytors, and partly out of policy to prevent an invaſion by making one, whereby the Enemies Country would become the Seat of the War,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:58409:73"/>they prepar'd an Army againſt <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and ſent for <hi>Cromwel</hi> out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> on whom they confer'd the Command of Capt.

And approaching to the Borders ſent the <hi>Scots</hi> a Declaration from the ptetended Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and another from himſelf, to juſtifie theſe proceedings. The <hi>Scots</hi> ſeem'd much ſurpris'd at this invaſion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out warning given, and therefore ſend to expoſtulate the Cauſe of it in a paper to <hi>Haſlerig</hi> then Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>New-Castle,</hi> in another to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and a third to the <hi>Iunto;</hi> in which they urg'd the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant</hi> and the former Union between the two Nations. But it was anſwer'd by a Declaration. <q>1. That the <hi>Scots</hi> (contrary to their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) had once already invaded
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:58409:75"/>
                  <hi>England</hi> under D. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and were now ready for a ſecond in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion; ſo that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were advanc'd againſt them onely by way of prevention. 2. That they had made a Peace with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy, &amp; promiſed him aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to regain the other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes he pretended to. 3. They had reſolved to impoſe their form of Religion upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q> Theſe were the grounds the <hi>Engliſh</hi> alledg'd for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. Accordingly <hi>Cromwel</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches into <hi>Scotland</hi> taking all the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons that lay in his way, till he came to <hi>Muſcleborough</hi> (a place famous for a ſignall defeat given the <hi>Scots</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the 6.) there he is ſet upon by Maj. Gen. <hi>Montgomery</hi> and Col. <hi>Straughan;</hi> but the aſſailants were put to the worſt. After which the two main Armies having for ſome time moved at a ſmall diſtance
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:58409:76"/>one from another, the <hi>Scots</hi> declined engaging till they got the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at a great diſadvantage at <hi>Dunbar,</hi> who by the difficulties of the place were ſo diſtreſs'd for proviſion, that they began to think of an eſcape by Sea, and would without doubt have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that courſe, had not the <hi>Scots</hi> confidence of Victory induc'd them to ſet upon them (contrary to the great prudent maximes of War, viz. To make a bridg for a flying Enemy, &amp; not to drive an enemy Army to the utmost of deſpair) The event of this engagement was, that the <hi>Scots</hi> in ſtead of an aſſured Victory received a totall overthrow; 3000. of them being ſlain in the field, amongſt whom was the Laird of <hi>Libberton</hi> &amp; Col. <hi>Lumſden,</hi> about 8000. with Sir <hi>Iames Lumſden</hi> Lieut.

            <p>The King in the mean time was withdrawn to St. <hi>Iohnston</hi>'s, being ſo ſenſible of the <hi>Scots</hi> unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that he apprehended as much danger from them as from the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.

The execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble murther of her Royall Father haſtned her death; whither the ſame Villaines at the helme of the State contributed any thing towards it, though reported, I will not affirme. Onely I know they were enemies e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to that family &amp; baſe enough,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:58409:77"/>to attempt as great a crime. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by ſome that the deceaſe of this Illuſtrious Princeſſe afflicted his Majeſty more then the loſſe of the Army at <hi>Dunbar;</hi> and perhaps he had reaſon, ſince himſelf ſeem'd leaſt concern'd in this, the Forces having been raiſed, and order'd wholly by the States and <hi>Kirk</hi>'s command and for their intereſt. About this time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo dyed the renowned Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range,</hi> to the great grief of the King, leaving his Princeſſe great with her firſt child, of which ſhe was ſafely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd four dayes after being a Son &amp; his Father's Succeſſour.</p>
            <p>About this time Col. <hi>Euſebius Andrewes</hi> having been found with a Commiſſion from his Majeſty was condemned by a High-Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and beheaded on Tower-Hill.</p>
            <p>Immediately after this notable Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, <hi>Cromwel</hi> made himſelf maſter of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and of <hi>Leith;</hi> onely the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:58409:77"/>Caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> held out for a good while after.</p>
            <p>The King being unable to bear the imperiouſneſs and hard impoſitions of the <hi>Eſtates</hi> and <hi>Kirk,</hi> extorting a Declaration from him to condemn his own proceedings and thoſe of his beſt affected party, baniſhing his friends from about him, &amp; uſurping the whole Government of all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs both Eccleſiaſtical and Civil into their own hands, and placing guards about his Perſon, &amp;c. ſecretly eſcapes from St. <hi>Iohnſton</hi>'s in much diſcontent (in order, as ſome think, to going beyond Sea) accompanied onely with four Horſemen toward the North of <hi>Scotland,</hi> where the Marquis of <hi>Huntkey,</hi> the Earls of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thol</hi> and <hi>Seaforth,</hi> Lords <hi>Ogleby</hi> and <hi>Newburgh</hi> with the <hi>Gourdons</hi> and the men of <hi>Athol</hi> were ready to appear for him with a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble force.</p>
            <pb n="136" facs="tcp:58409:78"/>
            <p> The <hi>Committee of Eſtates</hi> at St. <hi>Iohnſton</hi>'s were much ſurpris'd and troubled at this departure of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, eſpecially for that they fear'd he was gone to Mai.

Gen. <hi>Lesley</hi> is commanded forth againſt them. In the mean time while the <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>Committee of Eſtates</hi> are conſulting and debating what courſe to take with the King, ſome propounding, That ſince he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted them, they ſhould look no more after him but leave him to his own wayes; the more moderate jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it fit rather to teſtifie to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty their ſorrow for his departure
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:58409:78"/>and deſire him graciouſly to return: a different Faction of the Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters under the command of <hi>Straugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> and <hi>Kerr</hi> in the Weſt ſet forth a Remonſtrance to the <hi>Committee of Eſtates</hi> taxing them of <hi>imprudence and temerity in haſtning to conclude a Treaty with, receiving &amp; entertaining the King, before he had given any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing evidence of a reall change, after his commiſsioning</hi> Montroſſe <hi>to invade</hi> Scotland; judging <hi>his profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Cauſe &amp; the Covenant meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly counterfeit,</hi> as appear'd by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring <hi>Scotch</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnants (as they termed them.)

            <p>In this Seſſion a Committee was appointed to conſider of the State of Affairs, and examine obſtructions; by whom ſeverall perſons that were

And indeed to theſe two pernicious qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, Treachery and particular Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition (peculiar almoſt to that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) his Majeſtie's and that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome's enſuing misfortunes ought to be aſcrib'd.</p>
            <p>In the mean time his Majeſty was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry active in modelling his new Army, whoſe Rendezvouſe was at the Eaſt of <hi>Fife,</hi> encouraging them many times with his preſence and ſpeech, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> gaine two very ſtrong Caſtles, <hi>Hume</hi> and <hi>Trimptallon</hi> lying between <hi>Berwick</hi> and <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> the former by Colonel <hi>Fenwick,</hi> and

A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he was of great parts, honeſty and loyalty.

            <p>But to proceed; No conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions could unite the diſſenting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted <hi>Scots;</hi> The Clergy like fire brands were as eager to ruine their Countrey with their tongues, as the Sectarian Army could be with the ſword; <hi>Guthry, Cant, Duram,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:58409:87"/>Galeſpy,</hi> men of hot ſpirits, inflaming inconſiderable diſcontents to high outrages, as if a ſpirit of diviſion had wholly poſſeſs'd them, and ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted their judgements, that petty animoſities were proſecuted with greater zeal then the publick Cauſe. <hi>Malignants</hi> it ſeems had commands given them, and grew potent; this was the ground of conteſt. Some co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted Lords too, either for that they were Kirk-ridden, or blinded with envy and ambition, began to be diſſatisfi'd: whereupon <hi>Louden</hi> was diſcharged from being Chancellor, &amp; the Lord <hi>Burleigh</hi> ſubſtituted. This begat ill bloud. The Earle of <hi>Suther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> aſſembled about 500. men, and ſeem'd to intend them upon another account.

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:58409:87"/>Differences as to compleat his levies; to which purpoſe he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd an Act of the Parliament for levying fifteen thouſand foot, and eight thouſand horſe. Soon after which the Parliament adjourned till the ſeventeenth of <hi>April</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving the Civill Power in the mean time into the Hands of a Select Council, and the Military upon a <hi>Committee of VVar</hi> conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of twenty perſons choſen out of each of the Three <hi>Eſtates.</hi> Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall care was taken about the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of <hi>Sterling,</hi> the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf going often to haſten the compleating of them, and ſhortly after removed his Court from St. <hi>Iohnſton</hi>'s thither.

            <p> About this time alſo, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it advantageous to get into their power thoſe leſſer Iſlands which held out for his Majeſty, ſent their General <hi>Blake</hi> to that of <hi>Scilly,</hi> who with three hundred Seamen in a ſhort ſpace reduc'd the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant places in it.</p>
            <p>The Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> being reaſſembled at St. <hi>Iohnston</hi>'s after their adjournment, his Majeſty ſent a Meſſage to them, deſiring, 1. <hi>That the Act about the Claſſes of</hi> Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnants <hi>might be repeal'd.</hi> 2. <hi>That no more mention might be made of the name of</hi> Malignants <hi>amongst them.</hi> 3. <hi>That Duke</hi> Hamilton, <hi>the Earles of</hi> Calendar <hi>and</hi> Seaforth <hi>and others might have full command m the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</hi> Theſe propoſals which were of high importance to the common ſafety, and conſentaneous aſwell to Religion as seaſon of State, were
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:58409:89"/>notwithſtanding vehemently op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by <hi>Argyle</hi> and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted gang; yet the moderate party pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd, and they were carried in the affirmative. And having paſs'd theſe and the Act of Indemnity, and taken order for the preſſing of men, they diſſolved about the beginning of <hi>Iune.</hi> For the expediting the Levies, <hi>Argyle, Huntly</hi> and <hi>Seaforth</hi> were diſpatcht away to their ſeveral Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories. <hi>Cromwel</hi> in the mean time had been very ſick, ſo that there paſs'd little of action during that time; nor were the <hi>Scots</hi> willing to engage till their forces were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated. Maj. Gen. <hi>Maſſey</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived inſtruction to fall into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Horſe and Foot under his command, and together with the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> to join with a party in <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> that were to riſe for the King. The deſigne was chiefly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:58409:89"/>at <hi>London</hi> by ſome of the Presbyterian Clergy, who held cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with Maj. Gen. <hi>Maſſey,</hi> and contributed divers ſummes of money to his aſſiſtance. But a ſhip bound for the Iſle of <hi>Man</hi> being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into <hi>Ayre</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and Letters found in her which diſcover'd the whole Confederacy: whereupon the chief heads of it in <hi>London</hi> were apprehended, Mr. <hi>Cook, Gibbons, Love, Ienkins, Drake,</hi> and others; Two of whom, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Love,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gibbons</hi> had a formal tryall before a pretended High Court of Iu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtice. &amp; were beheaded on <hi>Tower-hill Au.</hi> 22. 1651. The reſt upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and ſupplications were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards releaſed. By this means the intended Irruption and Inſurrection were fruſtrated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cromwel</hi> being now recovered from his ſickneſs, &amp; having contracted all his forces into a Body by drawing in
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:58409:90"/>his out-guards or petty Garriſons, and having receiv'd great ſupplyes of Ammunition from <hi>Berwick</hi> and 80000. l. from the <hi>Iunto</hi> by Sea for his Souldiers, reſolves upon a ſpeedy encounter. His Forces conſiſted of 14. Regiments of Horſe and 12. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of Foot, 6. Troops of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons and 16. pieces of Ordnance. With theſe about the latter end of <hi>Iune</hi> he advances into <hi>Lithgow,</hi> and endevour'd to dare the <hi>Scots</hi> to an engagement, who lay ſtrongly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped at <hi>Torwood</hi> within 3. miles of <hi>Sterling;</hi> But they thought fit to decline battle till their Forces were compleated. Wherefore to intercept their ſupplies of proviſion Col. <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> was commanded with 1600. foot and 4. Troops of Horſe, to fall into the North of <hi>Fife;</hi> who accordingly embarking his men in ſmall Boats landed them at the North-Ferry in ſpight of all oppoſition; <hi>Cromwel</hi>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:58409:90"/>himſelf in the mean time marching with his whole Army cloſe up to the <hi>Scots,</hi> intending to fall upon their Rear in caſe they mov'd to diſturb the Enterpriſe. However, Maj. Gen. Sir <hi>Iohn Brown</hi> and Maj. Gen. <hi>Holburn</hi> were diſpatcht to drive the <hi>Engliſh</hi> out of <hi>Fife</hi> again; but before they could come up to them, <hi>Lambert</hi> and <hi>Okey</hi> were joyn'd with <hi>Overton</hi> with 2. Regiments of Horſe and two of Foot. And with this unexpected reinforcement, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> wholly defeated the <hi>Scots,</hi> killing 2000. up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the place, and taking above 1200 priſoners, among whom was the Commander in chief Maj. Gen. <hi>Brown,</hi> who did not long ſurvive this loſſe, but dyed (as is conceiv'd) of grief, having alwaies approved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his Majeſty a perſon of much fidelity and courage. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat was the bane of the <hi>Scotch</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. For ſoon after the <hi>Engliſh</hi> took
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:58409:91"/>in Garriſons almoſt as faſt as they approacht them. <hi>Brunt</hi> Iſland and a ſtrong Forth called <hi>Inneſgarvy</hi> ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate in an Iſle lying in the <hi>Frith</hi> were reduc'd by Maj. Gen. <hi>Lambert;</hi> and within a few dayes after <hi>Cromwel</hi> took the Town of St. <hi>Iohnſton</hi>'s after one dayes ſiege by ſurrender. This prodigious ſucceſſe cauſed his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty to alter his Counſels, and deſigne an irruption into <hi>England;</hi> which was reſolv'd upon out of probable hopes that many of his loyall Subjects there would betake themſelves to his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance when they underſtood he was in the head of an Army in it. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was a deſperate courſe; but (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the great Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,) what matter's it whether the remedy be deſperate when there is but one? <hi>Scotland</hi> was in a manner already loſt, the Army he had levyed were raw unexperienc'd men, and all the Garriſons round about were
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:58409:91"/>poſſeſt by the Enemy, whoſe Forces were far more numerous, and better provided of Ammunition and able Horſes, and beſides had been ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by frequent Victories, and the ſpoil of ſuch places, as they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Poſſibly in <hi>England</hi> his Majeſty might ſoon have forces competent to match them; at leaſt he ſhould not be beſet with ſo many difficulties, and one fortunate Field might whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turn the Scale. Accordingly, upon Thurſday <hi>Iuly</hi> 31. 1651. all things being in readineſs the Scotch Army left their Camp at <hi>Sterling</hi> (which was ſoon after deliver'd to Lieut. Gen. <hi>Monk</hi>) and the ſixt day after being about 16000. entered <hi>England</hi> by the way of <hi>Carliſle.</hi> Upon intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of this ſudden March, <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>'s Army (of which the greateſt part was in <hi>Fife</hi>) forthwith croſ'd the <hi>Frith</hi> and firſt <hi>Lambert</hi> is ſent with 5. Regiments of Horſe and Dragoons
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:58409:92"/>to fall upon the <hi>Scots</hi> rear; <hi>Cromwel</hi> himſelf ſoon after (<hi>Aug.</hi> 6.) follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with 8. Regiments of Foot, 2. of Horſe, and 8. great Guns, having left 6000. horſe and foot with Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant General <hi>Monck</hi> to reduce the remaining garriſons of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor General <hi>Harriſon</hi> being advanc'd the neareſt <hi>England,</hi> with 3000. horſe and Dragoons attended the motion of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army, and the <hi>VVeſtminster Iuncto</hi> ſuddenly beſtir themſelves to raiſe the <hi>Militia</hi> of the whole Nation, and make an Act to forbid all relief and ſuccour to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to his Majeſty or his Forces un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der penalty of High Treaſon. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the <hi>Militia</hi>'s of moſt Counties were drawn into the Field againſt him, and for the hindring of his progreſſe, 2000. of the County <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> and 4000. out of <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> and <hi>Cheſhire</hi> under Colonel <hi>Birch</hi> joyned with <hi>Lambert</hi>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:58409:92"/>and <hi>Harriſon;</hi> whoſe firſt attempt upon the Royal Army, was at <hi>VVar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington</hi> bridge, the paſſage of which was very ſharply diſputed, but at length gain'd by the <hi>Scots</hi> with the loſſe of ſome men. In the mean time a party in <hi>VVales</hi> began to riſe for the King, intending to have joyned with the Earle of <hi>Derby</hi> from the Iſle of <hi>Man;</hi> but the deſign was cruſht before it came to any thing. The march of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army was manag'd with extreme civility to the people as they paſt, no ſouldier daring to plunder or ſteal the leaſt thing whatever, having been terrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the puniſhment of one of their number who was ſhot to death for entering an Orchard. But as this carriage of theirs, together with his Majeſties invitations, did not ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon the people to come in to him as he expected, ſo by the way fear depriv'd him of about the fourth
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:58409:93"/>part of the Army he brought out of <hi>Scotland.</hi> It was deliberated by bis Majeſties council whether or no to march forthwith to <hi>London;</hi> but the way was too tedious, and the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were much wearied with their journey already, and it was hoped the intereſt Major General <hi>Maſſey</hi> had in <hi>Gloceſterſhire</hi> would procure a confluence of men from thoſe parts. Aſſon as the Army entred <hi>England,</hi> and afterwards at every Market-town his Majeſty was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed King of <hi>England</hi> by an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> man whom he had created King at Armes, with much ſatisfaction of the Country. However, ſuch was the fate of theſe Nations, for the puniſhment of whoſe ſins a ſevere yoke was reſerved by Providence, (for I know not what apparent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to aſcribe their actions to in this occaſion) that in ſtead of aſſiſting their juſt and lawfull Prince, they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:58409:93"/>generally in Armes againſt him. The Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> (who till then had been believ'd ſenſible of ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe for his former proceedings) appear'd in the F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The King in the mean time receiv'd no conſiderable ſupply, ſaving one Troop of Horſe commanded by a noble young Gentleman Sir <hi>Cecill Howard,</hi> ſon to the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> of <hi>Eſtrich.</hi> Nevertheleſſe there wanted not courage in the breaſts of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Gentry with his Majeſty, whoſe great reſolutions made them hope even in the midſt of deſpair. From <hi>Tong-Norton</hi> his Majeſty ſent a Trumpetter with a Letter and Summons to Col. <hi>Mackworth</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:58409:94"/>of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> which I ſhall venture to inſert with the Anſwer; His Majeſties Letter was in theſe words.</p>

            <p>The Summons alſo which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied this Letter was to the ſame effect. But whether the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour lookt upon his Majeſtie's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition too forlorn to engage on his ſide, or acted really out of an hoſtile principle, I will not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine: but the anſwer he returned to his Soveraign Lord the King was in the following termes directed,</p>

            <p> It having been reſolv'd upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate by his Majeſtie's Council rather to march Weſtward then towards <hi>London,</hi> his Army accordingly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd the City of <hi>VVorcester</hi> upon Friday the 22. of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> 1651. after one or two repulſes by the Forces that kept the City; the Inhabitants not onely not oppoſing the <hi>Scots</hi> entrance but helping to beat the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Souldiers out. In his Majeſtie's March hither he had ſent a Copy of his Declaration (in which he offer'd pardon to all that would return to their Allegiance) encloſed in a gracious Letter to the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of the City of <hi>London,</hi> which by order of the Uſurping <hi>Iun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> at Weſtminſter was on the 26. of <hi>Aug</hi> publickly burnt at the old Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change by the Hangman.

            <p>On Saturday the 23. of <hi>Aug.</hi> his Majeſty was there proclaimed King of <hi>Great Brittain, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> by Mr. <hi>Thomas Liſens</hi> Mayor and Mr. <hi>Iames Bridges</hi> Sheriff of the City, with the great acclamations and joy of the loyall Citizens.

            <p>The works of this City had for the moſt part been ſlighted a while before, and therefore all endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours were us'd to fortify it again. About two or three dayes before the King's arrivall at <hi>VVorcester,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> landed at <hi>VVeywater</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> with 250. Foot and 60.

               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:58409:97"/>to join with 500. more, and would probably have increas'd his forces in a ſhort time to a greater number. But Col. <hi>Lilburn</hi> being order'd to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent him with 3. Regiments and ſome Horſe out of <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> was forc't to an engagement by the Earl; out of a purpoſe to hinder him from joining with other forces which were ſent againſt him. The conteſt was ſharp and doubtfull for an hour, till at length the Earl's Forces were put to flight, &amp; himſelf being wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, narrowly eſcap'd to <hi>Worcester;</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall perſons of quality were ſlaine of his Party, as the Lord <hi>VViddring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> Sir <hi>Tho.

Cloaks with Stars, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 60. ſlain. The Earle of <hi>Derby</hi> &amp; Col. <hi>Roſcarrock</hi> after this overthrow, which was on the 25. of <hi>Aug.</hi> by the aſſiſtance of one Mr. <hi>Snead</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Elliot</hi> got to his Majeſty at <hi>Worceſter;</hi> where nevertheleſſe his Majeſty &amp; the Forces with him were reſolute againſt all diſaſters; the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications were carried on with all poſſible diligence, and the Mount at the <hi>South-East</hi> end of the Town ſtrongly ſecured.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide the Parliament by their new levies had encreaſed their Forces to a prodigious num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which as their own writers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, amounted to above 80000. About three dayes after the former Victory <hi>Cromwel</hi> marcht up before

               <hi>Worceſter</hi> with 17000. Horſe and Foot, beſides the parties under the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Groby, Lambert</hi> and <hi>Harriſon,</hi> which in all made up above 30000. men. The firſt encounter was at <hi>Vpton</hi>-Bridge 7. miles from <hi>Worceſter,</hi> which the Royaliſts had broken upon newes of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, onely one Plank (either through negligence or treachery) was left of it; over which <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> paſs'd ſome Redcoats, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the <hi>Scots</hi> took the alarum, fled into a Church. Whereupon Maj. Gen. <hi>Maſſey</hi> gave a camiſado to the Church; but in the mean time <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> having paſs'd over a ſupply of Horſe, fell upon the back of the Royalliſts, and overpowering them put them to a retreat, which was performed by Maj. Gen. <hi>Maſſey</hi> with much gallantry who was in the rear, ſometimes marching off and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fighting, till he eſcaped to <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter;</hi>

            <p>After this the Enemies diſpoſed themſelves in the manner they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd moſt convenient to ſtreighten the Town.

            <p>On the 29. of <hi>Aug. Cromwel</hi> fac'd the City with a great body of Horſe and Foot, but drew off again and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted nothing.</p>
            <p>But on Saturday <hi>Aug.</hi> 30. It was reſolv'd by his Majeſty at a Council of Warre to beat up the Enemies Quarters that night with 1500.

This ſally was made with much gallantry and reſolution; but the Enemy having receiv'd intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of the deſign, were in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to receive the Royaliſts; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs were unable to bear the ſhock, till bringing on ſucceſſively freſh forces, their number con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd

The Hearts of the beſieged were as couragious as thoſe of their enemies, and no doubtleſſe burnd'ned with leſſe guilt.

            <p>In the morning his Majeſty held a Council of War upon the Top of the <hi>Colledge-Church</hi> Steeple, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to view in what manner the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my lay From whence perceiving the Enemie's new bridges, and a kind of a skirmiſh at <hi>Powick</hi> bridge, he forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with commanded all to their Armes, and march'd thither himſelf, where he gave order for the making good of that paſſe and oppoſing that of the Enemy over <hi>Severne.</hi> Soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his return to the City, the Enemy aſſaulted <hi>Powick</hi> bridge fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, which was valiantly defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Brigade of Horſe and Foot under Maj.

            <pb n="179" facs="tcp:58409:100"/>
            <p> This place being won, there was no time to deliberate longer. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was reſolv'd to engage <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> forthwith, who lay at <hi>Perry-wood</hi> within a mile of <hi>Worceſter.</hi> The on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet was given with a great deal of fury by the Royalliſts, inſomuch that <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s invincible Life-guard was unable to bear the ſhock and compell'd to give ground in ſome diſorder; their great Guns alſo were for ſome time in the power of the Royaliſts. The Rebell Commanders had put the new rais'd County for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to bear the firſt brunt of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, of whom the Royaliſts made a horrible ſlaughter.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty himſelf lead up the <hi>Scots</hi> Foot in this battle, and that with ſo much courage and gallantry, that his inveterate ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my <hi>Cromwel</hi> could not but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud his valour. The Fight con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for the ſpace of three or
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:58409:101"/>four houres very ſharp and fierce, during which his Majeſty had his Horſe twice ſhot under him, and rallyed the Infantry himſelf; untill by the ſucceſſive ſupplyes of freſh forces they were in a manner all loſt. The Rebels had great advantage not onely in being more numerous, but fighting both with Horſe and Foot againſt his Majeſtie's Foot onely; for the <hi>Scotch</hi> Horſe did not engage at all in this encounter, which ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to the treachery of <hi>David Leſley</hi> who in the mean time commanded a brave body of Horſe to ſtand ſtill, and look on the ruine of their King and Fellow-ſubjects, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the firſt man that ſtirr'd with death. For the truth of which relation I dare not undertake; but it is certain the <hi>Scotch</hi> Horſe under <hi>Leſley</hi> were ſcarce any more then ſpectators of the battle, nor is it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible but that treachery might be
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:58409:101"/>practis'd by a <hi>Scot,</hi> and money imploy'd by <hi>Cromwel</hi> for conqueſt as well as force. The remainder of the forlorne Royall Army being put to flight were purſued into the Town by the Victors; his Majeſty was as one of the laſt in the field, and could hardly be perſwaded to out-live that day.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Sudbury</hi>-gate, through which the routed Royaliſts fled, an Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition Waggon was overthrown &amp; lay croſſe the paſſage, ſo that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty was enforc'd to alight and enter into the City on foot.

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:58409:105"/>that they might rally and try the fortune of another Fight. But many of the Troupers being obſerv'd to throw off their Armes and ſhift for themſelves, there was no encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to proceed in that courſe.

            <p>The Lords and their company being about 40.

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:58409:110"/>newly come thither to work; and this, to the end he might be unſuſpected by the reſt of the family. The good mother pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd his Majeſty a cleanly Fricaſſe of Bacon and Eggs, part of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaten by him, and the reſt by the Ruſticks, his Majeſty ſet forth with <hi>Richord Penderel</hi> on foot for <hi>VVales,</hi> intending to goe that night to the houſe of an honeſt Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Richard</hi>'s acquaintance at <hi>Madely</hi> in <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> 5. miles from <hi>VVhiteladies.</hi> When they had gone about 2. miles, an accident befell them wherewith they were in ſome fear. For as they were paſſing <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin Mill,</hi> the Miller, who had then in his cuſtody ſome conſiderable Royalliſts, hearing ſome perſons paſſe by, came out and demanded who is there? To which no anſwer was given, but his Majeſty and his conducter immediately left the way
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:58409:111"/>and waded through a Brook, which ſomething aſſwag'd the galling of his feet; and ſo they got free of the Miller, who was on the other ſide no leſſe fearfull of them. As they paſs'd through the Water his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty was in ſome danger of looſing his guide, had he not been directed by the ruſling of his Calve-skin bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches (as he afterwards pleaſantly obſerv'd) it being an extreme dark night. At mid-night they got to Mr. <hi>VVoolf</hi>'s houſe, and were by him heartily entertain'd. But the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent paſſing of the Enemies forces through that Town, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the likelyhood of their coming quarter at that houſe, made this Gentleman apprehend it unſafe for his Majeſty to lodge in it, and therefore he ſecur'd him and his ſervant <hi>Richard</hi> in a hay-mow. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their ſtay Mr. <hi>VVoolf</hi> had intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence brought him by a truſty ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:58409:111"/>(ſent abroad to that end) that all the bridges over <hi>Severne</hi> were kept by guards of the Enemies and all the paſſage-boats ſeiſed on. Whereupon by his advice having ſpent all that day <hi>(Fryday)</hi> in the barne, and being refreſh'd at evening in the houſe (where M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> 
               <hi>Woolf</hi> alſo made him a lotion for his hands with boyl'd Walnuttree-leaves) he departed about 11. a clock at night for <hi>Boſcobel</hi> houſe, where he arriv'd about 3. on <hi>Saturday</hi> morning. Col. <hi>Carlis</hi> (whom we formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd with honour for ſuſteining the brunt of the enemies in <hi>Sudbury</hi> ſtreet in <hi>Worceſter</hi> till his Majeſty got out of the Town) was fled into theſe parts, near which he was borne (na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely, at <hi>Bromhall</hi> in <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> within two miles of <hi>Boſcobel</hi>) and having lain in the wood for ſome time, was come that morning to the ſaid houſe to get ſome relief of his
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:58409:112"/>old Acquaintance, <hi>William Penderel;</hi> and by this meanes his Majeſty and the Colonel met together there; where congratulations being paſs'd, they were entertain'd with ruſtick fare, as bread &amp; cheeſe and a Poſſet, and care taken for refreſhing his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie's feet which were much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated and galled with travell. After which his Majeſty and the Colonel, conceiving the houſe leſſe ſafe then the wood, accordingly betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thither, and by the help of the <hi>Corydons</hi> climb'd into a large Oake, the thickneſs of whoſe leaves ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently conceal'd them from being diſcern'd by any ſpectator from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Upon this Oak, being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated with two pillowes &amp; ſome mean fare, they continued all the day, his Majeſty leaning in the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel's lap, and taking ſome ſlumbring reſt, of which he had had little or none the two preceeding nights;
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:58409:112"/>and in the mean time ſome of the loyall hearted Country people ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd near the place, and others went abroad to get intelligence.</p>
            <p>During his Ma eſtie's journey to Mr. <hi>Woolfs</hi> at <hi>Madely,</hi> the Lord <hi>VVilmot</hi> underſtanding his departure from <hi>White-ladies</hi> removed from Mr. <hi>Whitgreaves</hi> houſe at <hi>Moſely</hi> to that of Col. <hi>Iohn Lane</hi> at <hi>Bently</hi> near <hi>VValſal,</hi> South-Eaſt from <hi>Moſely</hi> about 4. miles, and intended to make uſe of an offer made him by M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> 
               <hi>Iane Lane</hi> the Colonel's Siſter to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany her to <hi>Bristol</hi> in order to his eſcape beyond Sea, ſhe having by accident procured a Paſſe from a <hi>Parliamentarian</hi> Officer for her ſelf and a man to go thither to ſee her ſiſter who was then near her time of lying in.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty and the Colonel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from the Oak at evening &amp; entred into <hi>Boſcobel</hi> houſe, where
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:58409:113"/>
               <hi>VVilliam Penderel</hi> ſhew'd his Majeſty the ſecret place in which the Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> had been conceal'd after his overthrow at <hi>Wigan,</hi> which the King lik'd ſo well that he reſolv'd to make his abode in it, till further opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity were offer'd for his eſcape be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sea, and not to go more to the Royall Oake, which afforded leſſe convenience. <hi>Humphry Penderel</hi> the miller having been that day at <hi>Shef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> a Town a few miles diſtant, where he was examin'd by a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarian</hi> Colonel (who had heard of the Kings having been at <hi>White-ladies</hi>) and threatned with the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of concealing his Majeſtie's Perſon, which was death without mercy, and withall inform'd that the <hi>Iunto</hi> propounded 1000 <hi>l.</hi> for a reward to any that ſhould diſcover him. But this true-hearted perſon was proofe againſt all temptations to diſloyalty, and related this paſſage to his Majeſty
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:58409:113"/>at night. Who having been enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd with a diſh of chickens took up his lodging upon a Pallet in the ſecret place. On the <hi>Sunday</hi> morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his Majeſty being deſirous of ſome mutton for that dayes food, &amp; all other wayes being dangerous, Col. <hi>Carelis</hi> with the help of <hi>William Penderel</hi> borrow'd a ſheep out of the neighbouring flock, part of which his Majeſty and the Col. together cut into collops, and cookt it in a frying pan for their own repaſt; after which his Majeſty ſpent ſome part of the day in reading, in a handſome tetir'd arbor in the garden, the loyall Brethren in the mean time ſcouting abroad for intelligence. And whether it were through particular provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or for that it was known that onely ſome ſervants kept <hi>Boſcobel</hi> houſe, the ſame was never ſearcht all the time of his Majeſtie's aboad there, but <hi>VVhiteladies</hi> upon a credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

                  </gap>l,</hi> and five miles on the other from Colonel <hi>Lane</hi>'s houſe at <hi>Bently.</hi> His Majeſty being diſabled by his former travel on foot, was forc'd to make uſe of <hi>Humphrey Penderel</hi>'s Mill horſe (which was ſuitably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutred) to go thither, leaving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him the faithfull and renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Colonel <hi>Carlis,</hi> who heartily pray'd for his Majeſtie's preſervation. Upon the way his Majeſty was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the five loyal Brothers, <hi>VVilliam, Iohn, Richard, Humphrey</hi> and <hi>George Penderel,</hi> and <hi>Francis Yates,</hi> each of them being arm'd with
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:58409:114"/>a good Bill or Pike ſtaffe, and ſome with piſtols, intending to have us'd the ſame in caſe they ſhould have met with a number not too great. Two of them march'd before, and one on each ſide of his Majeſtie's horſe; the other two at a diſtance behind: and they took all the by-wayes they could. His Majeſty being arriv'd at the place appointed, met one Mr. <hi>Huddleſtone,</hi> an honeſt Gentleman, there, ready to conduct him into Mr. <hi>VVhitgreave</hi>'s houſe. But before he entred he gave <hi>VVilliam, Humphrey</hi> and <hi>George</hi> the honour to kiſſe his hand, and thanking them for their fidelity, with promiſes to reward it, if it pleaſed God, he diſmiſs'd them with the horſe. My Lord <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot</hi> teſtified extreme joy at the ſight of his Majeſty, who alſo embraced him, and after ſome refreſhment gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to his Majeſty, and civill expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which he was pleaſed to uſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:58409:115"/>the two loyal Gentlemen Mr. <hi>Whitgreave</hi> and Mr. <hi>Huddlestone,</hi> he was conducted to the ſecret place intended for his lodging, which was more ſecure then commodious for his reſt. Before the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> betook himſelf to his repoſe, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with the two Gentlemen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the watching of all avenues, that timely notice might be given of the approach of any ſouldiers. <hi>And if it ſhould ſo fall out</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels have intelligence of your harbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any of the King's party, and should therefore put you to any torture for confeſsion, Be ſure you diſcover me firſt; which may perhaps ſtop their further ſearch, and preſerve the King.</hi> Such was the Heroical generoſity of that noble Lord, and his ſuperlative affection to his Prince.</p>
            <p>On the afternoon of the next day notice was given to Mr. <hi>VVhitgreave</hi> that ſome ſouldiers were in the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:58409:115"/>neighbourhood with intention to apprehend him for having been with his Majeſtie at <hi>VVorcester.</hi> This was a very ſurpriſing alarm. But Mr. <hi>Whitgraeve</hi> forthwith ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured his <hi>Royall Guest,</hi> who was laid upon Mr. <hi>Huddleſtone</hi>'s bed, and the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> in the ſecret place; and then ſetting open all the chamber-doors went boldly down to the Souldiers, convincing them by the teſtimony of his neighbours that he had not been from his own houſe in the laſt fortnight. Wherewith the Souldiers being ſatisfi'd went not up ſtaires at all; and ſo this imminent danger was eſcaped. The ſame night the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> repair'd to Col. <hi>Lane</hi>'s at <hi>Bently,</hi> in order to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie's going thither alſo; and during his abſence his Majeſty ſpent the next day in converſation with Mr. <hi>Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtone,</hi> in which he intimated to him that his Councils had been by
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:58409:116"/>ſome treacherous inſtruments very often diſcover'd to the Rebels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were put in execution by his loyall Subjects. At midnight Col. <hi>Lane</hi> came from <hi>Bently</hi> to attend his Majeſty thither; whereupon he took leave of M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> 
               <hi>Whitgreave,</hi> ſaluting her and giving her thanks for his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment: He expreſt himſelf alſo with much gratitude to Mr. <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greave</hi> and Mr. <hi>Huddleſtone,</hi> adviſing them to be very carefull of avoiding the dangers which might enſue to them in caſe they ſhould be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to have been inſtrumental in his concealment; and therefore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected them to a Merchant in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> to receive moneys for their tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſportation beyond Sea, if they thought fit. And laſtly he promis'd them to remember their civilities and fidelity to him, when ever it ſhould pleaſe God to reſtore him to his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions. Such was the goodneſſe
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:58409:116"/>of this excellent Prince, and his care for the preſervation of his preſervers. After this, his Majeſty gave them his hand to kiſſe, and they return'd him their zealous prayers and wiſhes for his ſafety. His Majeſty being ſafely arriv'd at <hi>Bently</hi> ſtaid there but a ſhort time, but took the opportunity of M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> 
               <hi>Iane Lane</hi>'s Paſſe, and rode before her to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> in the quality of her Servant, the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> riding for the moſt part at ſome diſtance from them. There his Majeſty hop'd to have gotten convenience of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation into <hi>France;</hi> but his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations fail'd him: for no Maſter of a Veſſel durſt undertake to waft over any ſingle perſon, unleſſe he knew certainly beforehand what he were. So that it being a Town of great reſort, his Majeſty was enforc'd to depart from it. Whither he went afterwards is not hitherto certainly known: Nor ha's it pleas'd his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:58409:117"/>or that Lady to diſcover to any. Severall paſſages are written to have hapned indangering his diſcovery both at <hi>Briſtol</hi> and elſewhere, but the relators have not the leaſt ground for any of them, and have rather choſen to gratify vulgar rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders with impertinent fictions then to confeſſe their ignorance of that which they did not and cannot yet know. The loyall Lady in all her journeys with his Majeſty comport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſelf with extraordinary pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and fidelity, expreſſing her ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance as often as opportunity ſafely permitted it, and at other times acting her part in the diſguiſe with much caution and diſcretion. A further relation of his Majeſtie's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe in <hi>England,</hi> and the manner of his tranſportation into <hi>France,</hi> aſſoon as it comes to our hands from the honorable perſon who, beſides his Majeſty, is now alone able to impart
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:58409:117"/>it, ſhall be preſented to the world. In the mean time I am glad I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord that he took ſhip at <hi>Brighthemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi> in <hi>Suſſex</hi> about the end of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 1651. and having by the Divine Providence eſcaped the greateſt dangers imaginable, in <hi>England,</hi> and ſome too upon the Sea, landed ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at <hi>Diep</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> where he ſtay'd not, but went forthwith to <hi>Roan,</hi> and from thence diſpatch'd Letters to <hi>Paris</hi> to give notice of his arrival; and in the interim was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht with accommodations befit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his quality by the Duke of <hi>Longueville.</hi> Intelligence of his ſafe arrivall being brought to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie's noble and generous Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle ſent his own Coach for him, which met him on the way as far as <hi>Magny,</hi> and coming nearer the City he was met by a company of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Gentlemen and conducted
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:58409:118"/>to the <hi>Louvre.</hi> Entertainment was there forthwith provided for him, and the Queen his Mother, and the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> viſited him the ſame night; The next day alſo the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> and <hi>Madamoiſelle</hi> his daughter viſited him together with the Dukes of <hi>Beaufort</hi> and <hi>Guiſe,</hi> Marſhal <hi>Turein,</hi> and other of the great Peers and Nobles of <hi>France,</hi> congratulating his happy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance; Nor was it long before the King of <hi>France,</hi> and the Queen Mother did the like, expreſſing their regret for his Majeſtie's diſaſters, and the great intereſt they took in his ſafety.</p>
            <p>Thus I have drawn into as nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row compaſſe as I could the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars and circumſtances of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie's preſervation, in each of which is remarkable his great patience and goodneſſe, and withall his exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fortitude in undergoing the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:58409:118"/>greateſt calamities that could befall a Prince on this ſide death. I have perhaps made too long a ſtory of it for this little Volume, but it was for the Reader's ſake, who I hope will be ſtirr'd up by it to praiſe the King of kings that deliver'd his Anointed from becoming a prey to thoſe that thirſted after his bloud. Certainly not only we, but even the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generations will have cauſe to bleſſe the Divine Providence, for that in the midſt of his judgements upon theſe Nations, he was pleaſed to preſerve ſo precious a mercy for them in ſtore; to the end that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been ſufficiently chaſten'd with the Scorpions of bloudy and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Governours for their ſins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their natural, pious and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sovereign, they might in due time be reſtor'd to the bleſſings which they had forfeited under the government of his excellent Son
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:58409:119"/>and his poſterity to the end of the world.</p>

            <p>The news of this victory cauſed great rejoycing amongſt the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Parliament, who now look't upon their new Commonwealth as founded to Eternity.

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:58409:120"/>Thankſgiving was appoint'd through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Nation. And indeed though there was nothing miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in the victory, the Parliamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians being ſix times the number of the Royalliſts; yet it may be ſaid to have been the Work of God, and they the inſtruments of his wrath upon the people of this Land, and the ſcourges of God, as <hi>Attila,</hi> that terrible deſtroyer of Chriſtendome was once called <hi>Flagellum Dei.</hi> The only Miracle was his Majeſtie's deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, in which the King of kings was pleaſed to remember mercy in judgement, and give us cauſe to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ore his Providence both in afflicting this Nation in this excellent Prince, and ſuffering wicked Tyrants, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers and Oppreſſours to proſper; in the mean time preſerving him in whom our hopes lay, from the hands of his bloud-thirſty ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>

            <p> And as if ſucceſſe attended impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Armes, the Garriſons of <hi>Scotland</hi> fell every day into the power of the <hi>Engliſh. Sterling</hi> Caſtle was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to Colonel <hi>Monck</hi> while <hi>Cromwell</hi> was at <hi>VVorceſter,</hi> and in it great ſtore of warlike Ammunition, with many of the Royal Enſignes.

            <p>On the 12. of <hi>September Cromwel</hi> entred triumphantly into <hi>London</hi> (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſent the poor captive <hi>Scots</hi> thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before him,) and on the 16. he went to the Parliament-Houſe, and

            <p>About the latter end of <hi>October,</hi> the Iſland of <hi>Ierſey</hi> was reduc'd by Colonel <hi>Hain</hi> and General <hi>Blake</hi> from Sea, and the Iſle of <hi>Man</hi> was ſurrender'd to Colonel <hi>Duckenfield</hi> upon Articles by the Counteſſe of <hi>Derby,</hi> whoſe renowned, pious and valiant Lord was at <hi>Cheſter</hi> adjudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to death for engaging with the King at <hi>VVorcester,</hi> by a Council of War, after quarter given, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed at <hi>Bolton</hi> in <hi>Lancashire</hi> on the 15. of <hi>October,</hi> with the teares and lamentations of moſt of the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatours.

            <p>His Majeſty having upon his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val at <hi>Paris</hi> been viſited &amp; congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by the King, Queen &amp; Nobles of <hi>France,</hi> had a Princely Attendance aſſigned him, and lodgings in the <hi>Louvre,</hi> where he lead a retired life in expectation of ſome happier oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity which it might pleaſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to preſent him with for the recovery of his Kingdomes, which he had now ſmall hopes to obtain by the aſſiſtance of his own Subjects in either of them; <hi>England</hi> being ſo ſtrictly overaw'd by the numerous Army kept on foot for that purpoſe, and <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> being in a manner wholly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:58409:122"/>by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Armes.

Moreover the Clergy were ſtill very high againſt the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</hi> But it ſeemes the deſignes of the Noble men were onely to make themſelves conſiderable, that they might treat upon better termes; For ſhortly after the Marquis of <hi>Huntly</hi> made his peace, the Lord <hi>Belcarris</hi> &amp; divers other Lords came in to the protection of Lieut.

Upon which termes he was left at liberty with aſſurance to enjoy his Eſtate. Had theſe Lords been cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall to the Royall intereſt, to which they had ſo ſolemnly ſworne a little while before, they might eaſily have maintain'd the Highlands againſt all oppoſition, theſe places being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally almoſt inacceſſible and invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding this low poſture of his Majeſtie's affairs, he was treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with much honour by the Princes and Nobility in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle de Orleans</hi> daughter to the late Duke of that Title, being a very rich Princeſſe, worth 60000. <hi>per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> and Soveraign Dutcheſſe of <hi>Montpenſier,</hi> ſhew'd great inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions towards him in relation to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:58409:123"/>It is alſo reported that there was a match deſigned between his Majeſtie's Brother the Duke of <hi>York</hi> and a daughter of the Duke of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueville</hi> (a Prince deſcended from the Royall Houſe of <hi>France</hi>) who was by her mother heire to the rich poſſeſſions of the Count of <hi>Soiſſons.</hi> But the great troubles ariſing about that time between the King and the Princes of the Blood hinder'd the ſucceſſe, the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> and his Daughter being far ingag'd with the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> againſt the King of <hi>France</hi> in a civil War, occaſioned by the imperiouſneſs of Cardinal <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarine,</hi> who during the King's mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority, had by means of his great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with the Queen ingroſſed the whole Government of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in a manner into his own hands, uſurp'd an inordinate power and all the grand offices, &amp; had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſeveral enormous, miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:58409:123"/>during the Queen Mother's Regency. The Princes of the Blood and generality of the Nation became ſo incenſed againſt him hereby, that an Arreſt was paſſed by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Paris</hi> for the baniſhment of the ſaid Cardinal, who thereupon retired to <hi>Colen,</hi> and all his goods were confiſcated. But the Queen having a great inclination to bring him back again into <hi>France,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> and <hi>Conde</hi> vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently oppoſed it; and when no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation could be made, the Prince withdrew his forces (which he commanded for the King's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice againſt the <hi>Spaniard</hi>) to <hi>Stenay,</hi> a ſtrong Garriſon, where making great levies he got a conſiderable power into the field. The Cities al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> owned the Prince's cauſe and quarrel. Whereupon the King rais'd a great Army commanded by Marſhal <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein</hi>

The Cardinal in the mean time return'd into <hi>France</hi> with 6000. men, and the Princes on the other ſide invited the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> to their aſſiſtance who had a merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Army of 10000. in the ſervice of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:58409:124"/>of by both Parties, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Deputies were ſent ſeverall times by the Princes to repreſent their grievances; but the King of <hi>France</hi> perſiſted reſolute not to part with the Cardinal, though the King of <hi>England</hi> urg'd him as far as poſſible, to gratifie his incenſed ſubjects, if not by diſmiſſing him altogether, yet at leaſt by ſending him upon ſome honourable foreign imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Of all which generous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours this noble, prudent and Chriſtian Prince obtain'd no other fruit, but an extreme hatred from <hi>Mazarine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the ſame time his Majeſty im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed himſelf in reconciling the <hi>French</hi> King and his ſubjects, upon hopes of thoſe endeavours ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he thought fit to deal with the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to tranſport his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my into <hi>Ireland,</hi> where ſome Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſtill held out. Which affair
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:58409:125"/>was ſo far proceeded in, that Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles were drawn up between the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Taaf</hi> on behalf of his Majeſty, by which it was agreed amongſt other things, <hi>That the Duke ſhould at his own char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges land an Army of</hi> 10000. <hi>for the reducing of</hi> Ireland <hi>to his Majeſty; That he ſhould be inveſted with the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Protector Royal of</hi> Ireland, <hi>and have four Towns put into his hands for ſecurity for his disburſements,</hi> with reſtrictions and cautions. But theſe Articles never came to be ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, partly becauſe the Duke was conſcious of his diſability to goe through with the enterpriſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray the charges of it, and partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was at the ſame time dealt with underhand by the King of <hi>France</hi> to relinquiſh the Prince's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and offer'd by him ſuch termes as they were not able to give him.

And then this Duke urging him of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to fight, found an extreme coldneſſe in him to the buſineſs, and preſently after under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood his conjunction with the Court-intereſt. Whereupon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed Princes exclaimed againſt the perfidiouſneſſe of the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi> and againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Princes as the cauſes of it. Who though they made it ſufficiently apparent that their tranſactions with the Duke

            <p>Shortly after the Victory at <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi> the pretended Parliament, as I ſaid, executed abundance of the Royall party; and ſuch as were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to live, had their Eſtates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated and were kept ſeverall yeares after in priſon.

            <p>About the Spring of the year 1652. broke out a furious War between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> &amp; the <hi>Dutch</hi> Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, after Embaſſadors had been

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:58409:128"/>no proneſſe to embrace their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as the Emperor once expreſly ſignified to him. And indeed ſuch was his Majeſtie's conſtancy that no temptations of worldly advantages, no reſentment of adverſity, nor the ſollicitations and arguments of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall grand Catholicks, who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to pervert him (as Mr. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagu, Militiere,</hi> and <hi>Salmonet</hi>) could prevaile any thing upon him. He propounded to the Dutch that if they would furniſh him with a ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of Ships, he would ſet up his own Flags and command them in perſon. Some of the Provinces were very inclinable to the motion, but that of <hi>Holland</hi> which ſtood out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the admitting of the young Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> for Capt.

            <p>On <hi>December</hi> 1652. the Engliſh <hi>Iunto,</hi> reſolved to be rid of his Majeſtie's younger Brother the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and referr'd it to the Council of State to conſider with what accommodation and to what place to ſend him. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, that they might ſeem to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing handſomely, ordered him to go into <hi>Holland</hi> &amp; gave him a Bill for 1000. <hi>l.</hi> to be paid to him upon his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival; but ſuch was their honeſty, that
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:58409:129"/>they took care that he ſhould never receive one penny of it. However, he was extremely reſpected at all the places he came at in the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, as at <hi>Dunkirk, Antwerp,</hi> the <hi>Hague, Leyden, &amp;c.</hi> And having been for ſome time entertain'd by his Royal Siſter, where he had the honour of the <hi>Garter</hi> ſent him from the King, he departed to the Court of <hi>France,</hi> being attended by Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdale,</hi> and Sir <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Greenvile;</hi> his Majeſty him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> Prince <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert,</hi> and others going two leagues out of <hi>Paris</hi> to meet him.</p>

               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:58409:130"/>to which he was the rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd for that Admiral <hi>Blake</hi> had not long before beaten and deſtroy'd the <hi>French</hi> ſhips under the Duke of <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſme</hi> that were going to the relief of <hi>Dunkirk;</hi> which defeat occaſion'd the loſs of that Town to the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> Nor were his hopes likely to prove more ſucceſsfull in the united Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, for they were ſo weary of the War, that they ſent a Letter to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to caſt about for an accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. But before they effected any thing, <hi>Cromwell</hi> finding his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious projects ripe, being embold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with former ſucceſſes, and backt with a ſtrong Army, on the 20. of <hi>April</hi> 1653. entred the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Houſe, attended with ſome officers, where he repreſented to them that their Diſſolution was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant to the publick good and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the Nation, with many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for it; which none daring to
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:58409:130"/>oppoſe, the Members departed the Houſe. To juſtify which Action He and his Council of Officers put forth a Declaration, wherein it was pretended, <hi>The Parliament was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled by a corrupt Party, who intended to perpetuate themſelves, deluding the Nation from time to time with hopes of a New Repreſentative,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Petitions <hi>of the Army and ſeverall Counties; That the Cauſe which God had ſo greatly bleſsed languiſht in their hands and was in danger to be loſt by their negligence of the publick and ſelf-ſeeking, with many more like crimes.</hi> And thus fell this great Idol of the Nation, this <hi>Parliamentum Infame,</hi> which in a dozen yeares time had wrought more miſchief to theſe Kingdomes, then all the preceeding Parliaments had ever done good. After this <hi>Cromwel</hi> with his Officers took the adminiſtration of Affairs into their
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:58409:131"/>own hands, the Armies in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Fleet aſſenting to their proceedings. But to gull the people a little longer and render Parliaments more contemptible to them, <hi>Cromwel</hi> upon the 8. of <hi>Iune</hi> following ſent out a ſummons in his own name, to ſuch perſons as he pleas'd to meet at <hi>VVeſtminſter</hi> on the 4. of <hi>Iuly.</hi> Who accordingly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to the number of ſix ſcore, he impowred them by a writing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Hand and Seal to be the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority and Governours of the three Nations, and that 40. of them ſhould be a <hi>Quorum</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch buſineſs. This <hi>Iunto</hi> of Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Officers of the Army going into the Parliament Houſe, in three dayes time gravely reſolved that they would be called <hi>the Parliament of the Common-wealth of England,</hi> and that their Chairman Mr. <hi>Rous</hi> ſhould be called <hi>Speaker,</hi> and that they
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:58409:131"/>would have a Sergeant at Armes and a Mace. Thus they began ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly, and continued in all their Actions for four moneths, in which they voted down the High-Court of Chancery, made a ſilly Act for Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages Births and Burials, confirmed the unjuſt Bill for Sale of the Eſtate of Sir <hi>Iohn Stowell</hi> Knight of the Bath, ordered Sale of the remainder of the Royall Revenue, made a tax for 6. moneths at 120000 l. <hi>per men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſem,</hi> ſtruck fiercely at Tythes, and Univerſities; and then being partly weary and partly aſham'd of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſome of <hi>Oliver</hi>'s faction by underhand appointment repaired to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and reſigned their power into his Hands, who at firſt ſeeming unwilling and excuſing his inability, was prevail'd with by importunity to accept it; which he did with the Title of Lord Protector of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of <hi>England, Scotland</hi>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:58409:132"/>and <hi>Ireland.</hi> The reſt of the Sectarian Convention who refus'd to break up the Parliament and doe as their fellowes had done, <hi>Cromwel</hi> ſent Souldiers to turn them out of the Houſe; which was accordingly done, and the doors lockt againſt them, <hi>Decemb.</hi> 2. 1653. And upon the 16. of the ſame moneth, having by the advice of his Officers framed and publiſhed an <hi>Inſtrument of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> conſiſting of 42. Articles, he ſent for the Commiſſioners of the Great Seale, the Major and Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>London</hi> with the Iudges and the Officers of the Army, and was by them ſolemnly inſtalled in <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-Hall,</hi> taking an Oath to rule ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Inſtrument and the Lawes of the Land, though nothing could be more repugnant to the Lawes then that Inſtrument.</p>
            <p>In this laſt year, notwithſtanding the former offer of Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:58409:132"/>ſeverall encounters had been between the Ships of this Nation &amp; thoſe of the United Provinces; in which the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſuffer'd much, ſo that the common people there were in a great conſternation. Two of the principal Battels were on the 3. of <hi>Iune</hi> and the 29. of <hi>Iuly.</hi> In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer the <hi>Engliſh</hi> got a remarkable Victory, though with the loſſe of one of their Generals, <hi>Dean,</hi> by a great ſhot, taking above 1300. priſoners and 11. Ships of War, beſides 6. ſunk. In the latter, being the greateſt blow the <hi>Dutch</hi> ever received from us, their Admiral <hi>Martin Harper van Trump</hi> one of the moſt expert and renowned Seamen in the world was ſlain with a Musket ſhot, and 2000. men more, 1000. Priſoners taken, and 27. Ships of War ſunk and fired. Which loſſes quite broke the ſpirits of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon began ſeriouſly to think of peace.</p>
            <pb n="244" facs="tcp:58409:133"/>
            <p> This Summer alſo it pleaſed God to viſit his Majeſty with a Fever which held him for ſome time with violence; ſo that the <hi>London</hi> Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets publiſh'd it to be mortal. But the Divine Providence intended better things to this Nation, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the latter end of <hi>August</hi> reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him to perfect health. After which he departed from the Court for ſome time to <hi>Chantilly</hi> not far diſtant from <hi>Paris,</hi> for better aire, being accompanied with Prince <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert,</hi> who after various fortunes at Sea and ſeparation from his brother Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> by a Hericano (who was never after heard off) put in with his Ships at <hi>Nantes</hi> at <hi>Britany,</hi> and reſided with his Majeſty for a long time at <hi>Paris</hi> in the Palace Royall.</p>
            <p>This year the Lord <hi>Hopton,</hi> who had commanded an Army for his late Majeſty in the Rebellion of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> dyed of a Fever after five dayes
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:58409:133"/>ſickneſſe, at <hi>Bruges</hi> in <hi>Flanders;</hi> a perſon of great learning, piety, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and valour.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the next year his Majeſtie's hopes of doing any good upon the United States were abſolutely extinguiſh'd. He had us'd all poſſible means by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions of his friends to avert them from reconcilement with <hi>England,</hi> and to that purpoſe was very active, upon the arrival of Monſieur <hi>Boreel</hi> their Embaſſadour to negotiate a League with <hi>France</hi> to promote the concluſion of it; but they had ſo deeply taſted of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> valour in the Sea war, &amp; were ſo impatiently deſirous of peace and Trade, that all he could gain of them in the end was a Letter of complemental civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. And accordingly, applications being made to the new pretended Protectour by two <hi>Dutch</hi> Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, the Lords <hi>Newport</hi> and <hi>Yong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall,</hi>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:58409:134"/>a Peace was concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two States, the Articles of which were proclaimed in <hi>London, April</hi> 26. 1654. Nor were his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie's ſolicitations for a Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> more ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſefull, though he proſecuted it with his utmoſt ardour, as judging it the moſt important expedient, whereby he might obtain aſſiſtance from theſe two Potent Monarchs; and other Princes alſo, together with the Pope himſelf, interpos'd for a Reconciliation. For the politick reaſons of Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> who knew the peace of the Kingdome of <hi>France</hi> depended on his removal out of it, induc'd him to venture the fortune of war, rather then be ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic'd (though deſervedly) to the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of that Kingdome. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken this reſolution, he judg'd it alſo his intereſt in the next place, to make a ſure friend of the new
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:58409:134"/>Protector of <hi>England,</hi> who being an Uſurper too, he conceiv'd would be more willing to join intereſts. To which purpoſe, all conſiderations of Honour, Generoſity (yea of affinity &amp; chariry) ſet aſide, by the Cardinals means, inſtructions were ſent over to Monſieur de <hi>Bordeaux Neufville</hi> (who had layen here a long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but had done little by reaſon of the unſettledneſs of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) to treat a League and Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy with the pretended Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector. Whether the Cardinal had any particular malice towards the King of <hi>England</hi> (as ſome affirme) I cannot determine; but this ha's been apparent in all his actions, That he will not ſtick to promote his own ambitious intereſt by the ruine of that or any other what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, being a greater Politician then to ſtickle at ſuch rules as the ſenſe of Honour, goodneſſe, or ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:58409:135"/>it ſelf may lay in the way of his proceedings. This his Majeſty ſufficiently underſtood, and foreſaw that by naturall conſequence the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Engliſh <hi>Mahomet</hi> and this Eccleſiaſtical Politician would produce his Excluſion out of <hi>France.</hi> Wherefore, he thought it more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to depart that Kingdome voluntarily, then ſtay till he were diſmiſs'd by Articles; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the 1. <hi>Iuly</hi> 1654. took leave of the King and Queen of <hi>France,</hi> and of his Royall Mother, with the French Grandees, from whom he receiv'd ſuch diſſembling language as that ceremonious Nation uſes on all occaſions. He went firſt to <hi>Chatil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> a Houſe belonging to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> being accompanied with his Illuſtrious Brother the Duke of <hi>York</hi> and his Couſins the Princes Palatines <hi>Rupert</hi> and <hi>Edward;</hi> having made ſome ſtay here, his Royall Brother
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:58409:135"/>returned to <hi>Paris,</hi> and from thence to the Army with the Title of Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant General under Marſhall de <hi>Turenne,</hi> who then lay with his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces beſieging the Archduke and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> with a numerous Spaniſh Army in their Trenches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Arras.</hi> Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> alſo here kiſt his Majeſtie's Hand and departed to <hi>Heydelberg</hi> to his Brother's Court, and from thence to that of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and prince <hi>Edward</hi> went to <hi>Bourbon.</hi> From <hi>Chatillon</hi> about the latter end of the ſame moneth his Majeſty went to <hi>Cambray,</hi> and from thence paſſing through <hi>Liege</hi> to the <hi>Spaw.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Cromwel</hi> playes the Tyrant in <hi>England</hi> at a high rate, and on <hi>Feb.</hi> 18. he ſent 11. perſons of quality to the Tower, for a conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy againſt his Highneſſe's perſon; but having no evidence againſt them, beſides his own guilty feares
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:58409:136"/>which ſuggeſted to him that moſt men wanted the power rather then the will to diſpatch him out of his Uſurped dignity) they were ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſet at liberty. The firſt Act of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and Council was to repeal the engagement made by the <hi>Infamous</hi> Parliament againſt a <hi>Single Perſon;</hi> which was done by an Ordinance <hi>Ian.</hi> 19. next the ſtyle of publick writings was alter'd from <hi>The Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,</hi> &amp;c. to <hi>Oliver</hi> Lord <hi>Protector,</hi> &amp;c. Then an Ordinance was paſs'd by his Highneſs and Council, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring Offences of Treaſon; which were made of three ſorts, 1. <hi>Attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting any thing againſt</hi> Cromwel <hi>and his Government.</hi> 2. <hi>Correſponding with, or promoting the right of his Majeſty.</hi> 3. <hi>Declaring that any Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was at preſent in being or had any continuance,</hi> &amp;c. So we ſee it came about that owning of the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> intereſt as they call'd
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:58409:136"/>it was now as great an offence as malignancy. Moreover to gratify Sectaries he made an Ordinance to eject ſcandalous Miniſters, by which many worthy Miniſters were depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of their livings in ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and to ſhew the more exquiſite malice, ſuch ejected were not to be admitted ever after to any Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical preferment, nor to teach ſchole or officiate as Chaplains in the Houſes of perſons of quality. He alſo ſet up an Inquiſition for approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Miniſters, by whom ignorant Fanaticks were prefer'd before grave and learned Divines, the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on running in termes that they ſhould have eſpeciall regard to ſuch as were indue'd with <hi>gifts and graces</hi> though they wanted humane learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Of theſe Inquiſitors were <hi>Rob. Tichburne, Hu. Peters, Ph. Nye, Th. Goodwin, St. Marſhal, Pet. Sterry, Syd. Simpſon,</hi> and, others of the like
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:58409:137"/>ſtamp. And that he might according to the courſe of Tyrants eſtabliſh his power in blood, by deterring all that lov'd their Country from attempting its deliverance, and removing ſome of thoſe he judg'd loyall and valiant enough to do it, upon the 20. of <hi>May</hi> a Plot was diſcover'd, for which ſeverall perſons of quality were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, as Sir <hi>Gilbert Gerrard</hi> and Col. <hi>Iohn Gerrard, Humphry Bagaley</hi> (Secretary to the late Earle of <hi>Derby</hi>) <hi>Sidney Fotherby,</hi> Somerſet <hi>Fox</hi>Eſq<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>, Mr. <hi>Tuder</hi> an Apothecary and Mr. <hi>Vowel</hi> a Schoolmaſter; there were alſo committed to the Tower the Earle of <hi>Oxford,</hi> Maj. <hi>Baily,</hi> Col. <hi>Aſhburnham,</hi> and amongſt others Sir <hi>Richard Willis.</hi> For the Tryall of theſe Conſpirators a High Court of Iuſtice was erected by an Ordinance of <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s <hi>Iune</hi> 13 of which <hi>Iohn Liſle</hi> was Preſident, and <hi>Steel, Tich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne,</hi> Sir <hi>Will. Roberts,</hi> and ſome
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:58409:137"/>twenty more (right qualifi'd for any murder it pleas'd the Protector to put them upon) Commiſſioners. Of the Gentlemen committed one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly three were tryed, <hi>Iune</hi> 30. Mr. <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard,</hi> Mr. <hi>Vowel,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> who were adjudged within the new-made Ordinance, and guilty of Treaſon, though by no Law of the Land, <hi>Glyn, Prideaux</hi> and <hi>Ellis</hi> like good Inſtruments of a Tyrant, ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Protectors will for Law. Yet the latter of them was repriev'd, and the two former ſuffer'd death with much reſolution and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, Mr. <hi>Gerard</hi> being beheaded on Tower-Hill and Mr. <hi>Vowell</hi> hanged at <hi>Charing Croſſe, Iuly</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scotland</hi> was not yet ſo abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubdued, but that there appear'd ſome ſtill in Armes for his Majeſty in the <hi>Highlands;</hi> The Earles of <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, Athol, Glencarne, Kinoole,</hi> the young Marquis of <hi>Montroſſe,</hi> the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:58409:138"/>Lord <hi>Lorne,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Forbes,</hi> and Sir <hi>Mungo Murrey</hi> having gather'd together ſeveral parties of Horſe and Foot, and making ſeverall irruptions upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the Low-lands: whereby they much moleſted them in their new poſſeſſions, ſometimes taking conſiderable booty, and ſometimes being worſted and flying into the Mountains where the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuers could not follow them. And thus they continued in expectation of greater Levies and the arrivall of Lieut. Gen. <hi>Middleton</hi> with ſupplyes out of the <hi>Low-Countryes.</hi> But in the mean time the <hi>Engliſh</hi> met with the moſt conſiderable party under the Earle of <hi>Glencarn</hi> and defeated them, the Earle himſelf hardly eſcaping; other like ſucceſſe alſo befell ſeverall other parties; ſo that they could not unite into one Body as they intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. At length Lieut. Gen. <hi>Middleton</hi> arrived out of <hi>Holland,</hi> with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:58409:138"/>proviſions of War, and a Commiſſion to be General, and <hi>Monroe</hi> to be his Lieut. Gen. This diſpoſing of Commands ſo incenſed <hi>Glencarne</hi> who had been imploying his utmoſt intereſt in levying Forces, which he now ſaw muſt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by others, that inſtead of conſpiring together againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy, theſe great Officers quarrell'd among themſelves; <hi>Glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carne</hi> was contented to be Lieut. Gen. but <hi>Monroe</hi> would not agree to it; whereupon a ſingle combate enſued between them, in which the Earle having wounded and diſarmed his Adverſary deſerted the ſervice with about 500. Gentlemen and made compoſition with the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Dunbarton</hi> to live peaceably at home. The ſame courſe was alſo taken by others by degrees. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Middleton</hi> ſtood out ſtill with much reſolution, till at length being
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:58409:139"/>ſet upon a great diſadvantage by Gen. <hi>Monck</hi> and Col. <hi>Morgan</hi> firſt in <hi>Arguyl</hi> and then at <hi>Loughary</hi> about the midſt of <hi>Iuly,</hi> he was wholly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown. Nevertheleſs he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the High lands with ſome Foot for ſome time after, till he ſaw moſt of the Nobility were either ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or made their ſubmiſſions, and then he retir'd back into <hi>Holland.</hi> The Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> was likewiſe concern'd in the publick deſolation, being broken up by Col. <hi>Morgan,</hi> and the petulant Miniſtry reduc'd to ſubjection.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Ireland,</hi> it was by the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Armes brought to ſuch a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as there was no fear of diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance for the future; onely ſome few <hi>Tories</hi> that kept themſelves in inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible places, ſometimes made irruptions to ſteal and plunder. The Parliament alſo erected a High-Court of Iuſtice there, of which <hi>Cook</hi>

On the 28. of the ſame moneth the ſaid Magiſtrates expreſt their affections to his Majeſty by entertaining him and the Princeſſe with a ſumptuous collation; who alſo the next day upon invitation went to <hi>Duſſel-dorp,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Newburgh</hi> treated them with all poſſible magnificence for ſome dayes.

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:58409:141"/>and complaining of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy advantage taken againſt him in the abſence of his Tutour, who was fitteſt to judge of their propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals. Wherefore he was removed to <hi>Paris,</hi> to the Houſe of Mr. <hi>Crofts,</hi> from thence to <hi>Pontoiſe</hi> again &amp; the inſtruction of Mr. <hi>VValter Montagu</hi> Abbot of <hi>Nanteul,</hi> and his former Tutor diſmiſs'd. Of theſe attempts ſome cordial Proteſtants certifi'd his Majeſty at <hi>Colen</hi> with all poſſible ſpeed, who reſented them ſo highly, that being ready to goe to dinner, when the intelligence was brought him, he would not think of eating till he had diſpatcht Letters away to <hi>Paris.</hi> In the mean time his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was reſtleſſely importun'd with perſwaſions to return to the <hi>True, Ancient, Apoſtolical, Roman Church,</hi> to embrace the Religion wherein moſt of his Anceſtours liv'd and di'd, and moſt of the <hi>Christian</hi> world, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:58409:142"/>with the King of <hi>France,</hi> his Royal Mother, and her Alliance profeſs'd; which were alſo back't with the allurements of the greateſt Church-Dignities and Revenues, and the Honours which that whole Nation would be ready to pay his Highneſſe, &amp;c. All which he declin'd with very ingenious anſwers; and ſhortly after a Gentleman went to his Highneſſe with a Letter from his Majeſty, and was admitted to his preſence; but not being able to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ſame privately, he caus'd it to be deliver'd by another hand. In that Letter his Majeſty minded him of the ſtrict command he had lay'd upon him at his departure out of <hi>France,</hi> of the horrid injury offer'd to his conſcience, honour, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, of the vanity of his perſwaders motives, and the falſeneſs and empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their promiſes; He alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd to him the more eligibleneſſe
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:58409:142"/>of any degree of ſuffering, and urg'd to him the fidelity of God's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, whoſe love he muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to looſe, together with that of himſelf a moſt affectionate Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in caſe he yielded to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiglements of his Temptours. Moreover, he deſir'd him to reflect on their dead Father's laſt charge, ſolemnly given him the day before his Glorification, with the entail of his bleſſing annexed. And in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, added, That if he either chang'd his Religion, or put himſelf into the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> Colledge, he had the laſt Letter from him, and muſt never look to ſee <hi>England</hi> or his face again: And that if (which God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid) their buſineſſe miſcarried for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the whole ruining of their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and all the Nations too, muſt be laid with all the conſequent miſchiefs at his doore as the chief cauſe of it. Aſſoon as his Highneſſe had read this
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:58409:143"/>admonitory Letter, he tranſcrib'd a copy of it, and ſent it to the Queen, deſiring her permiſſion to come to <hi>Paris,</hi> both in regard of theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the King and of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s approching return from the Army. To which her Majeſty anſwer'd, that ſhe ſhould not ceaſe wiſhing his eternall good by his converſion, to which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs ſhe would not force him, but wiſh'd him to hearken to what Mr. <hi>Montagu</hi> ſhould further deliver to him, which was that he would be willing to go to the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, where he ſhould have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme freedome in every thing. But all would not prevail upon his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; However he return'd to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris;</hi> whereabout the 18. of <hi>November</hi> the Marquis of <hi>Ormond</hi> arriv'd from <hi>Germany</hi> with Letters and new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions having taken a long and dangerous voyage by reaſon (the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:58409:143"/>lately diſſolved French Army had betaken themſelves to the robbing of all paſſengers.) Before the intent of his journey was known the Queen of <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Cardinal</hi> very clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely preſs'd him, and ſo did her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of <hi>England</hi> both her ſelf apart, and by Mr. <hi>Montagu.</hi> Which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities proving fruitleſſe, ſome ſeverities were proceeded to, which occaſion'd his Highneſſe to leave the Palace Royal and go to the Houſe of the Lord <hi>Hatton</hi>'s in the <hi>Fauxbourgs,</hi> where the former ſolicitations were renew'd, but with as little ſucceſſe. After which the Duke deſir'd the favour to ſee the Q. his Mother before his departure, but was refus'd; which denial having receiv'd with much grief, he went away with my Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi> to <hi>Collen</hi> where his Majeſtie reſided.</p>
            <p>But let us look back a little upon the actions of the Uſurper of his
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:58409:144"/>Majeſtie's Dominions. <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s new Inſtrument enjoin'd the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning of Parliament every three years, and accordingly he ſent out his new faſhioned Writs and new contriv'd Indentures for the return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Members, and that after a new way, ten or a dozen for moſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, one or two for Cities and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs, and many of theſe left whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out. The reaſon of which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was eaſier to pack ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in Counties by the intereſt of Army-Officers and other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, then in Borroughs. They aſſembled at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> on the 3. of <hi>Septemb.</hi> 1654. <hi>Cromwel</hi> meeting them in the Painted Chamber, made a Speech, in which he indevor'd to ſhew the neceſſity of his taking the Government upon him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the excellencies of it, telling them alſo <hi>that he did not deſigne to be a Lord over them, but their Fellow-Servant

Other things in the Government were exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable and alterable according to the State of Affairs. For his own part, his heart was even overwhelm'd with grief, to ſee any of them ſhould go about to overthrow what was ſettled,</hi> (viz. <hi>by his Inſtrument</hi>) <hi>contrary to their truſt received from the people.</hi> After this Preface he deliver'd them a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per (called a <hi>Recognition</hi>) to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by ſuch as intended to ſit; in which they were to engage <hi>to be faithfull to the Lord Protector and the Commonwealth, and not to propoſe or give conſent to alter the Government, as it was ſetled in one Perſon and a Parliament.</hi> Such as refus'd to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe were excluded from ſitting, the reſt repair'd again to the Houſe; where they took the Inſtrument in

But he having information given him all the way of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings by ſome falſe Members, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd them to ſpend 5. months allotted them by the Inſtrument to ſit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption, and the very next day after went to the Painted Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where upbraiding them with <hi>Parricide in not owning the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that called them thither, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to ſubvert the Government owned by God, as being the diſpenſation of his Providence after</hi> 12. <hi>years VVar,</hi> he diſſolv'd this Parliament (as he had done two before) <hi>Ian.</hi> 22. 1654. Within two dayes after their Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution a Plot was diſcover'd, which <hi>Cromwel</hi> ſaid was occaſioned, if not hatched by the <hi>Parliament</hi> it ſelf.

               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:58409:146"/>and Sir <hi>Iohn Packington</hi> of the ſame County were committed to the Tower thereupon; and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall perſons more in the North and Northweſt Counties of <hi>England,</hi> where the deſign was laid for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> and <hi>Chrik</hi>-Caſtle were to have been ſurpriſed, but it was prevented; the diſcovery of the whole Conſpiracy having been made to <hi>Cromwel</hi> by ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret inſinuating Agents of his from the firſt birth of it, till it was mature to break out. At <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> the Lord <hi>Newport,</hi> &amp; Sir <hi>Thomas Harris,</hi> who were the chief there, was taken priſoners and ſent up to <hi>London.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe others were not deterr'd from attempting ſomething for the deliverance of their Native Country from Bondage; for upon the 11. of <hi>March</hi> 1654. a body of 200. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting moſt of Gentlemen ſurpriſed <hi>Salisbury</hi> and took away all the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.

            <p>But the Protector wanted not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments in the Weſt to execute his bloody pleaſure: for at <hi>Salisbury, Iohn Liſle,</hi> one of his Princes Murderers ſentenced Col. <hi>Penruddock</hi> and Capt. <hi>Grove</hi> to the block, and at <hi>Exceter</hi> ſeven other perſons to the Gallowes. And now <hi>Cromwel</hi> reſolv'd to rule onely by the ſword, ſeeing the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſo hated his Tyranny; to which purpoſe he conſtituted eleven of his Officers to preſide over all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>England</hi> with the Titles of Major Generals, allotting four or five Counties as Provinces to each, with ſufficient authority not only in Military affairs, but alſo in Civil and Eccleſiaſtical.

            <p>In the mean time in England <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>'s feares or his malice were reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe; for about <hi>Iune</hi> moſt of the Gentry in all parts of the Nation

            <p>There having been this year a barbarous Maſſacre committed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Proteſtants of the Valleys of <hi>Piedmont</hi> by the Souldiers of <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor teſtifi'd his reſentment of it by appointing a ſolemn day of Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be obſerv'd, and a large con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:58409:153"/>to be gathered throughout the Nation for their relief. The col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections came to a vaſt ſum; but how well they were pay'd to thoſe for whom they were pretended, is not unknown to them that were employ'd about this affair into <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo toward the latter end of this year Propoſals were made to <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> by <hi>Manaſſeh Ben-Iſrael</hi> a Iew in behalf of the Iewiſh Nation for their free admiſſion to trade and exerciſe of their Religion in <hi>England.</hi> They had been excluded for the ſpace of almoſt 400. hundred years; yet <hi>Crem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> out of a ſenſe of charity for their converſion and in conſideration of 200000 l. was willing to liſten to their reentertainment.

            <p>In the beginning of the next year
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:58409:154"/>1656. the King of <hi>Spain</hi> being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s perfidiouſneſs, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly proclaimed Warre againſt <hi>England.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Cromwel</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into a ſtrict league both Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and Defenſive with the King of <hi>France,</hi> who was then at Wars with the King of <hi>Spain</hi> both in <hi>Flanders, Italy</hi> and <hi>Catalonia.</hi> One of the chief Articles of the Confederacy was, that his Majeſty with the Dukes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Gloceſter</hi> and all his Relations and Adherents (ſaving the Queen Mother) ſhould be excluded out of <hi>France.</hi> In which it is to be wondred with what ſenſe of honour that King could conſent to ſo baſe and ignoble a propoſall, made by one that had murdered his Uncle and Uſurped his Dominions, and withall to baniſh ſuch Princes as were ſo near of Blood to him, and came to him for ſuccour and relief. But ſelt-intereſt (not ſelf-preſervation for what
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:58409:154"/>could <hi>France</hi> fear from <hi>Cromwel,</hi> when he was ingag'd with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and jealous every day of the people he tyrannis'd over?) ſelf-intereſt, I ſay, of not of the King of <hi>France,</hi> at leaſt of Cardinal Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine the Queen's creature, prevail'd above all reſpects of honour, juſtice, and the ſenſe of humane calamities. The King wiſely withdrew before, and the Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> not long after; there remain'd onely the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> who during his ſervice in the French Army had acquir'd to himſelf a great renowne and a high command. Nevertheleſſe he had ſome ſmall time reſpited for his ſtay, in which he was viſited, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably treated by Marſhal <hi>Turenne</hi> (who infinitely eſteem'd and lov'd him for his extraordinary courage &amp; skill in Martial affairs) &amp; others of the French Lords as alſo by the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> (who was then occasionally
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:58409:155"/>in that Kingdome.) And ſhortly after he took his leave of the King of <hi>France,</hi> the Queen his Mother and the reſt of the Court, and departed into <hi>Flanders.</hi> In the mean time the King of <hi>Spain</hi> partly out of a noble generoſity, and partly out of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration that having engag'd in a Warre againſt <hi>Cromwel,</hi> his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie's intereſt might be of ſome advantage to him, cauſed <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> his Governour in the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> to invite his Majeſty into his Territories, which invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was made by the Count of <hi>Fuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaldagne,</hi> a great Commander, and lately Governour of <hi>Milan.</hi> His Majeſty accepted of the offer, and departed from <hi>Colen</hi> to <hi>Bruges</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> where he was received with great expreſſions of honour and reſpect.

            <p>In <hi>England Cromwel</hi> being much neceſſitated for money, and withall impatient to tarry longer for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation by the people (which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he could not obtain of the preceeding Parliament he hoped he might gain of another) attempted once more to call a new Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative. But remembring the carriage of ſome in the former, he gave pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate intimation to certain perſons in ſeveral Counties to obſtruct (if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) their Election again in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Seſſion, and writ Letters to ſome Sheriffs to the ſame purpoſe. Nevertheleſſe though they were choſen after the new mode, 10. in a County and 1. in a Burrough, the ſucceſſe of theſe practiſes did not ſo
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:58409:156"/>well pleaſe him, but that when they aſſembled (<hi>Sept.</hi> 17. 1656.) above ſeven ſcore of the returned Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were excepted againſt by the Protector; and when they addreſſed to the reſt that were admitted into Houſe to have their Elections exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd, the Parliament unworthily betray'd their own Priviledges, and referr'd them to <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Council. Sir <hi>Thom. VViddrington</hi> was choſen Speaker. After this beginning, they proceeded to make the following Acts. I. <hi>An Act for diſannulling his Majeſtie's Title to the Government of the three Nations, paſs'd</hi> nemine contradicente. II. <hi>An Act making it Treaſon for any to attempt compaſſe, or imagine the Protector's death; and appointing ſuch Offenders to be tryed not by a Iury of</hi> 12. <hi>ſufficient men, but by a High Court of Iuſtice.</hi> This Act was occaſion'd by a Plot of one <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dercomb,</hi> who had deſigned to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:58409:156"/>the Protector, and was therefore try'd at the King's Bench Bar, (his accuſer being one <hi>Toope</hi> of <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>'s Life-guard) and condemned to be hanged drawn and quarter'd. But the night preceeding the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for his execution; he was poyſoned either by himſelf or ſome others. III. <hi>An Act for an Aſſeſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> for 60000 l. per menſem for 3. <hi>years.</hi> IV. <hi>An Act for conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing Tonnage and Poundage.</hi> V. <hi>An Act for preventing multiplicity of Buildings in and about the Suburbs of</hi> London. This Act concerned not onely ſuch as were to be built here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, but alſo thoſe that had been reared upon new Foundations for almoſt 40. years before; for which the owners were fined one year's Rent to <hi>Cromwel:</hi> and it extended to buildings ten miles round about London. VI. <hi>An Act for Exciſe of Merchandiſe imported;</hi> Hobby-horſes,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:58409:157"/>horſes, Children's Rattles, and old ſhirts not exempted. But the great Act of all was called <hi>An Humble Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition and Advice,</hi> in which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was ſettled upon <hi>Cromwel</hi> for his life, and upon whom he ſhould nominate to ſucceed him. While it was in agitation it was mov'd in the Houſe by Alderman <hi>Pack</hi> (a Knight of <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s making) that he might be deſir'd to take upon him the <hi>Title of King.</hi> The <hi>Iunno</hi> who knew his mind in part before, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently proſecuted the motion, and appointed <hi>St. Iohn, Glyn, VVhitlock, Liſle, Fines, Lenthall,</hi> and others of the like ſtamp to be a Committee to attend him to that purpoſe. Theſe men courted him very eagerly to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of that Title; nor did he ſeem much averſe, yea it is more then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable he thirſted after it; &amp; that the deſign was fram'd by himſelf; for <hi>Thurloe,</hi> his Secretary openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:58409:157"/>it. Nevertheleſs he ſhuffled off and on in many conferences with them at <hi>VVhite-Hall;</hi> till at length, being deterr'd by the non-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance of the Army, he anſwer'd <hi>that he could not undertake the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment with the Title of King.</hi> Whereupon it was reſolved he ſhould be ſtill term'd Protector. By this <hi>Petition</hi> amongſt many other things, it was enacted there ſhould be an <hi>Other Houſe</hi> conſiſting of 70. perſons to be nominated by <hi>Cromwel</hi> himſelf, and ſummoned thither by writs, as the Peers of <hi>England</hi> were wont to be. And this was deſign'd by <hi>Cromwel</hi> as a way to gratifie his great Officers, whom he intended by this means to make Lords; as alſo to the end, that having effected his deſires by this <hi>Iunto</hi> who both eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd him in his Government and gave him 1900000 l. <hi>per annum,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all Crown Lands unſold, with
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:58409:158"/>all other Emoluments, to maintain it for his life, if after Parliaments ſhould attempt to reſcind theſe Acts, his other Houſe, might perpetually check them by their negative voice. Theſe Acts being paſt by him, he was on <hi>Iune</hi> 26. 1657. ſolemnly ſworn and inveſted with Robes of Purple Velvet by the Speaker of the <hi>Iunto</hi> in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> having alſo a Sword, a Scepter and a Bible deliver'd to him. In which formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he return'd home, and the <hi>Iunto</hi> prorogued their ſitting to the 20. of the next <hi>Ianuary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Spring of this year <hi>Cromwel</hi> according to agreement made with the <hi>French</hi> King ſent over 6000. Foot under Col. <hi>Reynolds</hi> into <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> to aſſiſt him there againſt the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> theſe Auxiliaries did the taking of <hi>Montmedi</hi> and St. <hi>Venant,</hi> two very advantageous places, and

His Majeſty of <hi>Britain</hi> had an Army at that time conſiſting of 2000. <hi>Engliſh, Scotch</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formadoes, which deſpairing of any other occaſion to employ as yet, he permitted upon requeſt to be made uſe of by the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> They were commanded by the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and amongſt other Forces ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the attempting of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dike.</hi> Accordingly an aſſault was made upon the place by night, with much reſolution and courage; but the aſſailants were forc'd after ſix hours conflict, to retire. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> hereupon forthwith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girt <hi>Dunkirk</hi> with a ſtraight ſiege, the former being commanded by Col. <hi>Lockhart</hi> and the latter by Marſhall
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:58409:159"/>
               <hi>Turenne.</hi> To oppoſe this deſign Don <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and the Marquis of <hi>Caracene</hi> aſſembled 7000. Foot and 9000. Horſe, and brought them to <hi>Fuernes</hi> Fort. The beſiegers were indeed more numerous, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore left ſufficient Forces to ſecure their Trenches, and drew forth the reſt to encounter the Enemie's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my The firſt onſet was made by a <hi>Forlorne hope</hi> of above three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Engliſh</hi> Foot, who were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by the reſt of their Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men under <hi>Lockhart.</hi> They charged with ſuch fury upon the <hi>Spanish</hi> Foot (who had advantageouſly drawn up upon a Sand-Hill) that notwithſtanding that difficulty, they totally routed the whole Body. Whereupon the <hi>Spanish</hi> Horſe alſo, ſeeing their Infantry put to the rout, betook themſelves to flight, nor could by any indeavours be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:58409:159"/>to make a ſtand. Upon which occaſion, the <hi>French</hi> Horſe who had ſtood ſpectators onely of the conflict, fell in upon purſuit of the flying Enemy, from whom they found little oppoſition but what was made by the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, who put ſuch a ſtop to the impetuous career of the whole <hi>French</hi> Army, as conduc'd much for the ſafety of the routed <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who otherwiſe had in all probability been totally cut off. Nevertheleſſe at length the numerouſneſs of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuers overpowred the valour of theſe Reſiſters, ſo that being much tyred with the violence of the encounter, and no relief coming, they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd to deſert their ſtation and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelves to flight. Few of them eſcaped; among which were the Dukes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Gloceſter;</hi> though the firſt was not heard of till three dayes after; which gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:58409:160"/>to a general ſuſpicion that he was taken by the French Forces, and ſecretly diſmiſs'd at a fit opportunity by the Marſhal of <hi>Turenne.</hi> In this battle of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> 800. Officers were taken priſoners, and 2000. pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Souldiers; the number of ſlain was uncertain. The conſequence of it was the loſſe of <hi>Dunkirk;</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of <hi>Leyda</hi> (Governor thereof) being ſlain in a Sally, it was ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred upon Articles, and by the King of <hi>France</hi> and the Cardinal in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon put into the hands of the <hi>Engliſh, Iune</hi> 25. 1658.</p>
            <p>While theſe things were in agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation beyond Sea, the pretended Parliament reaſſembled on <hi>Ian.</hi> 20. and thoſe Members who had been excluded the laſt Seſſion were now admitted. There was alſo an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Officers and ſome few others in the Houſe of Peers, ſummon'd thither by <hi>Cromwel</hi> as Lords. But the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:58409:160"/>Commons, being now a full Houſe, began to review the late Humble Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition and Advice made by a packt <hi>Iunto,</hi> and refus'd to treat with the <hi>Other Houſe</hi> as Lords, Wherefore <hi>Cromw.</hi> in a great fury haſted to them in a Hackney Coach and having ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them ſufficiently diſſolved them <hi>Feb.</hi> 4. yet with this word of conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his <hi>Other Houſe, My Lords! ye are Lords and ſhall be Lords.</hi> This was the fourth Parliament he diſſolved; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving before violently turn'd out the <hi>Long-Parliament,</hi> the <hi>little Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> the <hi>Recognition Parliament,</hi> &amp; this garbled <hi>Iunto.</hi> There goe's a ſaying concerning the three latter, which were ſummoned by <hi>Cromwel</hi> himſelf; <hi>that the Firſt was called but not choſen, the Second did juſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and the Third did nothing just.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, <hi>Cromwel</hi> reſolv'd to maintain what he had gotten <hi>per fas
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:58409:161"/>&amp; nefas.</hi> He had called his eldeſt Son <hi>Richard</hi> out of the Country to inure him to a Court life and Publick Affairs, and placed his ſecond, <hi>Henry,</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> the room of <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> whom he recalled from thence, wanting, as he ſaid, his Preſence and Counſel. Moreover he had married his two youngeſt Daughters in the foregoing <hi>November,</hi> one to Mr. <hi>Rob. Rich.</hi> heir apparent to the Earldome of <hi>VVarwick,</hi> and the other to <hi>Thomas</hi> Viſcount <hi>Faulconbridge.</hi> And having thus ſettled himſelf, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to rule at his pleaſure, diſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ever having the complyance of a full and free choſen Parliament. On the twelfth of <hi>March</hi> he ſent for <hi>Tichburn</hi> then Lord Mayor of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> the Aldermen and Common Council, and acquainting them with the imminent danger of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth by reaſon of ſecret Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations from ſome Ill-willers to
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:58409:161"/>his Government, gave them order for ſettling the Militia. Whereupon the guards were doubled and a ſtrict watch was ſet in all parts of the City. Shortly after divers perſons were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and impriſoned; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others Doctor <hi>Iohn He wet</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of St. <hi>Gregories</hi> near <hi>Paul</hi>'s, Mr. <hi>Iohn Ruſſell</hi> brother of the Earle of <hi>Bedford,</hi> Sir <hi>VVilliam Compton</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Earl of <hi>Northampton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Iohn Mordant</hi> brother of the Earle of <hi>Peterburgh,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard VVillis,</hi> Sir <hi>VVilliam Leighton,</hi> &amp; many more of leſſe quality. Hereupon follow'd a day of ſolemn Humiliation, and a High-Court of Iuſtice; before which was brought firſt S. <hi>Henry Slingsby</hi> of <hi>Yorkſhire;</hi> he was accuſed of Treaſon by one <hi>VVaterhouſe</hi> and one <hi>Overton</hi> Officers in the Garriſon of <hi>Hull,</hi> for conſpiring to ſeize upon that place for the King; Next him was brought to Tryall Dr. <hi>Hewet;</hi> he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached

The ſame day Mr. <hi>Mordant</hi> was alſo arraigned before the ſaid High-Court for a treaſonable deſign; but he made his innocence ſo appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent againſt all the evidence, that he was acquitted. Sir <hi>Henry Slingsby</hi> and Doctor <hi>Hewet</hi> received ſentence of death (pronounced upon them by Preſident <hi>Liſle</hi>) on the 2. of <hi>Iune,</hi> and notwithstanding the interceſſions of great friends, were beheaded on <hi>Tower-Hill</hi> on the 5. of the ſame moneth. A few dayes after one <hi>Mallery,</hi> the betrayer of all the reſt, was try'd <hi>pro forma</hi> and condemn'd, but repriev'd. Other perſons were alſo try'd, whereof ſome were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitt'd, ſome condemned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieved;
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:58409:162"/>but three perſons were dealt with in the greateſt rigour, being hang'd, and quarter'd, namely Col. <hi>Edw.

Theſe murders were uſher'd in with a Faſt and concluded with a day of Thankſgiving. Sad newes was this to his Sacred Majeſty, who could not but be infinitely ſenſible of the ſufferings of theſe loyall perſons, as well as of the calamitous ſtate his intereſt was thereby brought into. However he gave not himſelf up to penſiveneſſe and unprofitable ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, but repaired for a while to <hi>Antwerp</hi> with the two Dukes his Brothers and the Princeſſe his Siſter, from whence alſo he went to <hi>Bruxels</hi> and reſided there for a good ſpace, being entertain'd there ſplendidly by Don <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and deſired

            <p>In <hi>Auguſt Elizabeth Cleypole</hi> daughter to <hi>Cromwel</hi> and wife to one <hi>Iohn Cleypole</hi> dyed at <hi>Hampton</hi>-Court, much troubled in mind by reaſon of the bloody actions of her Father (as was reported.) But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were ſo or no, this is certain that <hi>Cromwel</hi> never injoy'd himſelf after her death, and did not ſurvive her a full moneth. He lay ſome while in a very ſad condition with extreme torment and pain in his bowels; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe he could not endure to think of dying, but ſaid the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, <hi>That God had revealed to him that he ſhould not dye, and that he had a great deal of glorious work for him ſtill to do in theſe Nations.</hi> But on <hi>Friday Sept.</hi> 3. he departed this life, or as ſome ſay on <hi>Aug.</hi> 30. at what time was the moſt furious violent
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:58409:163"/>wind, that ever hapned in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of man. Immediately upon his death, his Council met, and upon the affirmation of Dr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> that he nominated his ſon <hi>Richard</hi> to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him, or for that they judged it the moſt expedient courſe, they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd him to be proclaim'd Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor accordingly. Which was done the next day in the City of <hi>London,</hi> and his new Highneſſe took an Oath preſcrib'd in the <hi>Humble Petition and Advice. Richard</hi>'s firſt care was the Interment of his Father, and ſearch was made into the Records to ſee what had been expended upon the buriall of former Kings, to the end greater coſt might be beſtow'd upon his. All the gaudry was not provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded till the 23. of <hi>Novemb.</hi> and then his Image was drawn in great pomp to <hi>Weſtminster Abbey</hi> and lay'd in a ſtately Herſe.

In the mean time many congratulatory addreſſes were made to him from Counties, Cityes, Burroughs, and Regiments of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, full of flattery and profaneſſe, ſome of them comparing, the old Tyrant to <hi>Moſes</hi> and his Impe to, <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> the Guides and conductors of Gods people out of <hi>Aegyptian</hi> thraldome.

And to the end the Army might be kept in obedience to them, they made the Speaker of the Houſe <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</hi> caſhir'd many Officers, and caus'd new Commiſſions to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd by the Speaker in the Houſe of Parliament to all the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers both of Land and Sea-Forces. The affections of the people they did not much value, ſo long as the Army would ſtand to them. To gratifie whom they impos'd a whole years Tax at 35000. <hi>l. per menſem,</hi> to be paid immediately. After which about <hi>Iuly</hi> they paſs'd an Act for ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling the <hi>Militia</hi> of Counties in ſuch hands as they pleaſed: But <hi>Lambert</hi> and the other Officers (who intended to have the whole guard of the Rump, and aim'd at other
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:58409:165"/>deſigns) not reliſhing this proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it was laid aſide.</p>
            <p>Nothing could have been more odious to the Nation then this re-eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Rump</hi>-Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; who taking theſe courſes to ſecure the perpetuall continuance of their ſitting and reſolving never to encreaſe their number by admitting their fellow-members or new ones legally elected in their places, awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſpirits of moſt of the Gentry of the Nation to attempt ſomething for their Countries liberty by reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ancient Government. A great inclination there was in moſt Counties to take up Armes, and ſeveral Offers were made in divers places, but none was ſo conſiderable as that in <hi>Cheſhire, Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſhire,</hi> and the parts adjoyning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Sir <hi>George Booth,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Middleton,</hi> and other Gentlemen in thoſe parts. They declar'd <hi>for a full</hi>

               <hi>and free Parliament</hi> to be elected by the People. Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Westcheſter,</hi> and was reported to be very numerous. Whereupon <hi>Lambert</hi> was ſent out againſt him with an Army of ſix or ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, and a train of Artillery; moreover forces from all quarters were appointed to draw to him, ſo that all meeting he had a very puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Army. The party under Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> had been in Armes a a good time before <hi>Lambert</hi> came againſt them in expectation that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Counties would have done the like; but this hope failing, upon <hi>Lambert</hi>'s approach, many of them withdrew from him. The reſt came to an encounter with <hi>Lambert</hi> at <hi>Northwich,</hi> and were without much difficulty defeated. The number of the ſlain was not many, but the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners were in great multitudes; Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> himſelf was alſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:58409:166"/>a few dayes after taken in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe in an Inne at <hi>Newport-Pagnel</hi> in <hi>Bedfordſhire</hi> as he was coming up to <hi>London.</hi> Perſons of quality taken beſides him were the Earle of <hi>Derby,</hi> the Lord <hi>Kilmurrey,</hi> Major General <hi>Ranulph Egerton,</hi> Sir <hi>William Neile,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Powel</hi> of <hi>Flintſhire,</hi> Col. <hi>Maſſey</hi> of <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> Major <hi>Peter Brook.</hi> The Earle of <hi>Stamford</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Leventhorp</hi> were alſo impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd in other places with ſome hundreds of Gentlemen for deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to levy war againſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. The <hi>Rump</hi> overjoy'd with this ſucceſſe preſented <hi>Lambert</hi> with 1000. <hi>l.</hi> to buy him a jewel, but he thought it more ſuitable to his deſignes to diſtribute it amongſt his Army.</p>
            <p>During theſe actions in <hi>England</hi> his Majeſty privately withdrew from <hi>Bruxells</hi> together with the Duke of <hi>York;</hi> it was imagin'd by many that
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:58409:167"/>they were come concealed into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in expectation of the event, or at leaſt lay upon the Sea-coaſts ready to have tranſported ſome forces in a Fleet which rode upon the Coaſt of <hi>Flanders,</hi> in caſe matters had ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded proſperouſly. But not long after the ſuppreſſion of the <hi>Cheſhire</hi> Inſurrection, they appeared again at <hi>Bruxells;</hi> from whence his Majeſty diſpatcht an Embaſſadour to attend with certain Propoſals at the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of Cardinal <hi>Mazarini</hi> for the <hi>French</hi> King and Don <hi>Lewis de Haro</hi> for the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> who met upon the confines to treat a Peace between the two Crowns and a Marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King of <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta</hi> of <hi>Spain.</hi> The Embaſſadour was entertain'd by the two grand Miniſters with very high teſtimonies of honour and reſpect, and promiſed to have his Maſter's Intereſt taken into conſideration aſſoon as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:58409:167"/>of their own would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</p>
            <p>But in <hi>England</hi> the pretended Parliament fell eagerly to their old beloved Trade of Sequeſtration, and determin'd, to exerciſe the utmoſt of ſeverity upon the actors in the late Inſurrection. And no doubt they they would have proſecuted their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, had not Providence divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their malice by a breach which fell out between them and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Officers of the Army. <hi>Lambert</hi> (whoſe ambition inſtigated to him to be ſo active in the late change of Government, and ſo popular in the management of his late expedition) together with other grand Officers thought the Parliament ſo oblig'd to them for reſtoring them to Power and preſerving them in it, that they conceiv'd none of their demands ought to be denyed. Whereupon at their return to <hi>London,</hi> a Petition
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:58409:168"/>was preſented to the Houſe by <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> for a <hi>General.</hi> The <hi>Iunto</hi> remembring how their former Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral had ſerv'd them not only deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this requeſt, but vacated the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions of <hi>Lambert, Desborough</hi> and 7. others, and voted the ſupreme command of the Army into the hands of ſeven Commiſſioners, whereof two or three were Army-men, the others Members of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Lambert</hi> and his Companions were ſo incenſed herewith that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the 11. of <hi>Octob.</hi> Forces were drawn out on either ſide at <hi>VVeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster;</hi> thoſe for the <hi>Iunto</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>Haſelrig, Morley</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; thoſe for the Army, by <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> himſelf, <hi>Desborough, Berry,</hi> and other Colonels; and had not the Council of State interpos'd, they had charg'd one another. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe the Army-party prevail'd, and turn'd the <hi>Rump</hi> out of doors,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:58409:168"/>
               <hi>Oct.</hi> 13. Which being done the great Officers being aſſembled in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at <hi>Wallingford</hi>-houſe diſpos'd of commands among themſelves, <hi>Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> was made General, <hi>Lambert</hi> Lieutenant General, <hi>Desborough</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Horſe, and that they might ſatisfy Gen. <hi>Monck</hi> too, who govern'd <hi>Scotland,</hi> they made him Major General of the Foot. As for civil Affairs they erected a <hi>Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of Safety,</hi> conſiſting chiefly of Army-Officers and ſome Members of the diſſolved <hi>Iunto,</hi> who cided with them, as <hi>Vane, Salwey,</hi> &amp;c. The council of Officers alſo for ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the people put forth a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration concerning their late pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, charging the <hi>Rump</hi> with high Crimes, and making void their late pretended Acts. Moreover they appointed certain perſons to frame a Model of Government: which no queſtion would have prov'd an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:58409:169"/>one, when onely Sword-men and Tradeſmen were to be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers. But that which check'd their contentment in theſe courſes was the diſſatisfaction of Gen. <hi>Monck</hi> in <hi>Scotland.</hi> Letters of expoſtulation paſt to and fro between the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and <hi>Fleetwood;</hi> but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army in the mean time prepar'd to march againſt him forthwith, and was led towards the North by <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> conſiſting of about 12000. men. The General ſeeing them thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand with him, ſent Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to treat, yet with all march'd Southward with what Forces he could raiſe and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifi'd <hi>Berwick</hi> upon <hi>Tweed.</hi> The Commiſſioners going beyond their Inſtructions, the General was not ſatisfi'd with the Treaty, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſoon after deſir'd another at <hi>New-Caſtle;</hi> during which he call'd a <hi>Convention of Eſtates</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:58409:169"/>who not only approved his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking but aſſiſted him in it. While things ſtood thus, the City of <hi>London,</hi> though they well enough lik'd the turning out of the <hi>Rump,</hi> would by no means join with the Army; But about the beginning of <hi>December,</hi> the Apprentices and ſome others fram'd a Petition to the Lord Mayor and Aldermen <hi>for a Free Parliament;</hi> the Souldiers underſtanding it inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, and a great hurly burly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon aroſe in the City, ſome being ſlain and others wounded. <hi>Fleetwood</hi> was therefore deſir'd to draw his Forces out of the City; but inſtead of doing that he placed Garriſons in ſeveral parts of it, threatning to fire it if the Citizens ſtir'd. At the ſame time <hi>Haſelrig, Morley</hi> and ſome other Rumpers ſeis'd on <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> and declar'd againſt the Army; and part of the Navy under Vice-Admiral <hi>Lawſon</hi> did the like, and blockt up
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:58409:170"/>the <hi>Thames.</hi> The City in this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would declare neither for <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> nor <hi>Army,</hi> but ſtill deſired a free <hi>Parliament,</hi> which at laſt was conſented to upon divers enſlaving qualifications and proclaim'd by the <hi>Committee of Safety</hi> to begin on <hi>Ian.</hi> 24. Upon the borders all this while nothing was done, the Treaty took no effect; nevertheleſſe Gen. <hi>Monck</hi> kept from engaging, nor was it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for <hi>Lambert</hi> to draw him to it, whoſe Forces quartered in a cold barren Country, unable to march by reaſon of the hardneſſe of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. At length <hi>Fleetwood</hi> having treated with <hi>Lawſon</hi> to no effect, and his ſouldiers being ready to mutiny for want of pay, was forced out of apprehenſion of worſer conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, to give over ruling; and the <hi>Rump</hi> ſlipt into the Houſe again on <hi>Decemb.</hi> 26. late in the evening by Torch-light. Upon the news hereof
<pb facs="tcp:58409:170"/>
               <hi>Lambert</hi>'s Army deſerted him, and General <hi>Monck</hi> enter'd into <hi>England</hi> with his, about the 6. of <hi>Ian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilſt affairs were thus turbulent in <hi>England,</hi> his Majeſty being at <hi>Diepe</hi> in <hi>Normandy</hi> receiv'd an invitation from Don <hi>Lewis de Haro</hi> the great <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſter at the Frontier of <hi>Spain.</hi> Which his Majeſty accepting, rid poſt <hi>incognito</hi> through <hi>France,</hi> being accompanied onely with the Lord Marquis of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Briſtol.</hi> Upon information of his approach to <hi>Bayonne,</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Favourite went forth with a ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Traine to meet him, and upon the firſt ſight of him alighted from his Horſe, and notwithſtanding the inconvenience of the place, in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry humble poſture embraced his Majeſtie's knees; from whence alſo he conducted him (riding all the way bareheaded) to the beſt lodgings the place afforded. On the next day
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:58409:171"/>his Majeſtie was viſited by <hi>Mazari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> whom he entertain'd with that diſcreet warineſſe that he let him know he ſufficiently underſtood his projects. The reſult of his Majeſtie's conſultations with Don <hi>Lewis,</hi> was, that the Favorite in his Maſters name promiſed him all aſſiſtance both of men and mony, aſſoon as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the <hi>French</hi> peace permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Whereupon his Majeſty after high careſſes and treatments, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed privately by Poſt to <hi>Paris,</hi> where ſtaying with the Queen his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome few dayes, he departed to his former reſidence at <hi>Bruſsels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This private journey occaſion'd ſo certain a belief in the Sectarians here in power, that his Majeſty and the Duke of <hi>York</hi> (who lay at <hi>Calis</hi>) were come over into <hi>England,</hi> that many perſons were apprehended for them and particularly one Mr. <hi>Colt</hi> was taken and impriſon'd for
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:58409:171"/>the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and others alſo for his Majeſty.</p>
            <p>We left Gen. <hi>Monck</hi> upon his march out of <hi>Scotland;</hi> all parties had their hopes fixt upon him, the <hi>Rump</hi> preſuming by his aſſiſtance to quell the refractory City; and the Citizens, that he would enforce the <hi>Rump</hi> either to call in the Members ſecluded in <hi>Dec.</hi> 1648. or to fill up the Houſe with new Elections; yet none knew certainly his intentions. During his March he was addreſs'd to by ſeveral Counties, for the ſame things that the City deſir'd, who alſo ſent their <hi>Swordbearer</hi> as far as <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> to congratulate his coming, and tender the reſpects and affections of the City to him. Yet he gave ſuch anſwers as were not ſatisfactory to any. The <hi>Rump</hi> alſo ſent two of their Members (<hi>Robinſon</hi> and <hi>Scot</hi>) to wait upon him, but indeed rather as ſpies to watch and obſerve him. At <hi>St.</hi>
               <pb n="320" facs="tcp:58409:172"/>
               <hi>Albans</hi> ſome Aldermen and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Council men of <hi>London</hi> were ſent to him from the City to court him, but were return'd, as all others, only with thanks for their reſpects. On <hi>Friday Feb.</hi> 3. he marched into <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and was lodg'd at <hi>White-hall;</hi> being much careſs'd by the <hi>Rump,</hi> and receiv'd their thanks in the Houſe. The City continuing ſtill their refractorineſs to the <hi>Rump;</hi> and perceiving they ſo delay'd the filling up of the Houſe, as if they never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it, on <hi>VVedneſday Feb.</hi> 8. paſs'd a Vote in Common Council, not to pay or levy any Taxes until ſuch time as they might have a full &amp; free Parliament. This ſo enrag'd the <hi>Rump</hi> that they order'd the General to march with his Army into the City, pull up the Chains and Poſts, break down the Gates and Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullis, and impriſon divers Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Commiſſioners. Which
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:58409:172"/>was accordingly executed the next day to the great terror and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not onely of the City, but of the whole Nation when they heard the report of it.</p>
            <p>But this conſternation did not laſt long; for the General reflecting on the odious ſervice the <hi>Rump</hi> had put him upon, and apprehending their intentions to retrench his power (which indeed his Commiſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that day expir'd they did accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, joyning him with ſome of their Members and Officers in the ſupreme command of the Army) on <hi>Saturday Feb.</hi> 11. drew his Army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Finsbury</hi> fields, and preſently after upon ſome conference with the Lord Mayor and ſome chief Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, writ a Letter to the <hi>Iunto,</hi> as from <hi>VVhite-Hall,</hi> ſubſcribed by Himſelf and 14. of his chief Officers, wherein he told them with what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret <hi>he had executed their late Orders
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:58409:173"/>in relation to the Chaines, Poſts and Gates of the City, which he fear'd would be ſo far from anſwering the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected end, that it would rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the diſcompoſure of mens ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in the Nations;</hi> minding them alſo, <hi>That the ground of his coming into</hi> England <hi>was, not only to return them to their truſt, but alſo to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Liberties of the People,</hi> &amp;c. He alſo complain'd, <hi>That</hi> Lambert, Vane <hi>and others, impeached of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, &amp; that had acted in the illegal and tyrannical</hi> Committee of Safety, <hi>were yet ſuffer'd to continue in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the City, and ſome too in the Houſe and in the Army,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That they were contriving to take away the maintenance of the Miniſtry; That they were framing another Oath to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon the people, and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe had countenanced a bold and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Petition from the Fanatick Party.</hi> And laſtly he deſir'd, <hi>That by
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:58409:173"/>the</hi> Fryday <hi>following they would iſſue out VVrits for filling up the Houſe upon due and reaſonable Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and put a certain and ſpeedy pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to their ſitting, according to their frequent Declarations.</hi> This Letter produc'd not greater regret in the <hi>Rump,</hi> then it did joy to the City and whole Kingdome, which was teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd at night by Bone-fires and ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Bells, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The time ſet for filling the Houſe being expir'd, and nothing done by the <hi>Rump</hi> in order thereunto, the formerly ſecluded Members upon addreſſe to the General, and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him not to be againſt a ſingle perſon, were on <hi>Feb.</hi> 21. permitted to take their ſeats in the Houſe, after 11. years excluſion. The Houſe now augmented by above a 100. Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, take care for ſettling the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and firſt they conſtituted Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Monck</hi> Commander in chief of

And laſtly having made proviſion for ſettling the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaa of the Kingdome, and calling a new Parliament to convene at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster April</hi> 25. they diſſolved themſelves by Act on <hi>Friday March</hi> 16.

<pb n="325" facs="tcp:58409:174"/>been interrupted for 5. years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and for ten weeks by <hi>Lambert.</hi>

            <p>His Majeſty in the mean time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Court at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> to <hi>Bruges</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and reſided there for a good ſpace; but being now in fair hopes of reſtitution to his Dominions departed from thence toward the latter end of <hi>March</hi> to <hi>Breda,</hi> a handſome Town ſcituate in <hi>Brabant,</hi> about 10. leagues from <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and belonging to the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>

For <hi>Lambert</hi> having made an eſcape out of the Tower, appear'd in armes about <hi>Northampton</hi> in the head of a party, many caſhier'd ſouldiers and fanaticks repairing to him. But this danger was timely remov'd by Col. <hi>Rich.

In the mean time great numbers of perſons of quality daily flocked over to <hi>Breda</hi> to his Majeſty, who ſtay'd not long there, but removed to the <hi>Hague,</hi> where himſelf and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentry were ſplendidly entertain'd at the charge of the States, who alſo preſented him with gifts of great value. From thence the Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi> with the Princeſſe of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the young Prince, accompanied his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and the two Dukes to the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, where they were entertain'd in the <hi>Naſeby</hi> with a magnificent col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and ſo his Majeſty took leave of them, and ſet ſail for <hi>England.</hi> At his landing at <hi>Dover</hi> he was met by

            <pb n="333" facs="tcp:58409:178"/>
            <p> Arriving at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> the Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of both Houſes congratulated his return in two ſolemn Speeches, to which his Majeſty anſwer'd that the People's acclamation (together with his journey) though gratefull to him as demonſtrations of affection, had ſo diſordered him that he could not give ſuch an anſwer as he deſir'd. But they ſhould find him a ſincere Defender of the Lawes and Liberties of the people, and the Parliament ſhould not be more ready to ask his conſent to any thing fitting to be done then he would be to grant it. After which he retir'd out of the Banquetting Houſe to his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>Thus we have trac'd out all the principal actions of this great King's Life, in his Infancy, Youth,. and Manhood to this preſent, as well in his own Territories as beyond the Seas, and withall given an account
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:58409:179"/>of the moſt conſiderable events here in <hi>England</hi> during the Oligarchy of the late long Parliament, and the Tyranny of <hi>Ol. Cromwel.</hi> In all which we have endeavour'd to give an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall Relation with as much bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity as the ſmalneſs of this Volume (containing more ſtrange occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences then have hapned in ſome A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges) would permit. May the God of Heaven, who of his infinite and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerved mercy towards theſe poor Nations hath reſtor'd his Majeſty to his Dominions, long preſerve his Sacred Perſon for the good both of Church and Commonwealth, and multiply the years of his Reign in Honour, and Proſperity.</p>

               <hi>Glory be to God on High; and on Earth Peace and good Will towards Men.</hi>
